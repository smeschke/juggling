Others say that you should just try to juggle the pattern for as long as possible, only stopping when you drop a ball. Both of these approaches have some merit, so I personally recommend a compromise method. You should not stop juggling based on a particular number of throws, but instead stop when the pattern becomes unstable.

      "p8": "To learn Olas, it is best to break the trick down into two basic components, the catch and the multiplex. The odd revolving catch of Olas is best learned by starting with two balls in your non-dominant hand. Throw one into the air, as if in a Cascade pattern, and then claw catch it with your dominant hand. Right as that catch is made, throw the the second ball, and swing you dominant hand back around and claw catch that ball as well.",

      "p10": "Practice this catch until it is second nature with both hands. The second part of Olas is the multiplex throw, which may take some practice to master. If you aren't already familiar with a multiplex throw, it is a throw in which you release two balls simultaneously. In this case, one ball will be passed straight into the other hand, while the second ball will be thrown to the other side as if in a normal Cascade. Before any of this happens, you will also be making a normal cascade throw with a ball in the other hand, which will travel over the two multiplexed balls.",

You should now have two balls in you dominant hand, and one ball in the other. Throw that ball out of your non-dominant hand as if in a Cascade, and then perform a multiplex with the two balls in your dominant hand, just like in the animation above. Resume a normal Cascade afterward.",

Instead of returning to a Cascade after the multiplex, you are instead going to toss the passed ball back across your body, and then claw catch the more lofty multiplex throw. Using a revolving catch, you are going to then grab the ball thrown from your other hand, and then multiplex again out of that end, repeating the pattern on the other side of your body. If you are having a hard time visualizing the continuation, watch the animation below closely, paying particular attention to what happens after the multiplex throw (the balls are colored for added clarity).",

Make a roughly vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your non-dominant side) while simultaneously swinging your dominant hand under and around the thrown ball. As the ball peaks, your dominant hand should be circling over it; you will then throw the ball in your dominant hand over toward the non-dominant side of your body and claw-catch the first ball. So far this should all feel pretty similar to Rubenstein's Revenge. After the claw-catch you will then swing your dominant hand in a \"C\" shape toward the dominant side of your body while making a throw from your non-dominant hand—the throw will be made from the center of your body toward your dominant side, but it should be mostly vertical. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown by your dominant hand.

By simply supplementing this variation an additional chop element, the Chop Shower establishes a more mechanicallystable and balanced pattern while also improving the overall appearance.",

Notice that each arm plays a different role; one arm can be described as thetop arm and the other serves as the bottom arm. While maintaining the same ball paths, switch the arm roles. As noted above, this will likelyfeel quite awkward. The next step is to note where the top arm is catching the ball, and raise that point so that your forearm is verticallyoriented when the catch is made. This higher catch reduces the in-flight time, allowing time for a chop to be made prior to the next throwby that hand. For the chop, try to keep your elbow close to your body and as stationary as possible, so that your forearm rotates like thehand of a clock.

If you are having trouble carrying the chopped ballbetween the other two balls, you can experiment with either chopping over both of the other two balls, or underneath them, as shown below.

Simultaneously, you are going to bring your non-dominant hand directly underneath the multiplexed ball closest to it (the same ball that your dominant hand is now under). Once your hands are in these positions, you are going to make a vertical throw from your dominant hand, immediately followed by a vertical Fork \"throw\".

Next,release the shuffled-over ball so that it falls downward and then very quickly move that same hand upward to catch the ball it justthrew.
