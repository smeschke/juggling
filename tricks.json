      "description": "     The Five Ball Cascade is the \n\tbase pattern for five ball juggling. It has the same basic structure as the \n\tthree ball Cascade, with each ball being thrown from one hand to the other \n\tin an arch across the body. For most jugglers, the Five Ball Cascade is one \n\tof the first patterns encountered that can't simply be learned in a day or \n\ttwo. Instead, it requires months and sometimes even years of practice to \n\tbecome proficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n    For this reason, a step-by-step walthrough is not \n\tparticularly helpful. Therefore, this tutorial will instead outline \n\timportant juggling exercises that can be done to accelerate your progress. \n\tThe first exercise to practice is the <strong>\n<a href=\"../4balltricks/552.html\">552</a></strong>.<strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/552.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    </strong>While certainly distinct from the Five Ball Cascade, \n\tsince many throws are made sequentially from the same hand, the 552 is a \n\trelatively slow-paced pattern that uses throws of roughly the same height \n\tand trajectory as the Five Ball Cascade. This is very important, since your \n\tsuccess at mastering that pattern hinges on making accurate throws. Once you \n\thave mastered the 552, it is time to move on to the <strong>\n<a href=\"../4balltricks/5551.html\">5551</a></strong>.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/5551.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The 5551 maintains the same throws as those found in the 552, \n\texcept for the addition of a horizontal pass. This pass is what gives the \n\t5551 more value for learning the Five Ball Cascade, since the throws are \n\tfaster and always alternate hands. Once you become comfortable with the \n\t5551, the final exercise to practice is the <strong>\n<a href=\"../4balltricks/55550.html\">55550</a></strong>.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/55550.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The 55550 is essentially a Five Ball Cascade juggled with \n\tonly four balls. The only real difference between the two patterns is that \n\tthe final throw of the Five Ball Cascade is missing. The 55550 forces you to \n\tpay close attention to the cadence of your throws, since the gap normally \n\tpresent in the pattern can easily disappear with sloppy timing. Upon mastery \n\tof this final exercise, you are ready to add in the fifth ball. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Start with three balls in your dominant hand and two balls in \n\tyour non-dominant. Make a high Cascade throw from your dominant hand, and \n\tfollow it up with two more identical throws, alternating hands each time. At \n\tthis point, three balls should be in the air, and one ball should be in each \n\thand. The first ball that you threw from your dominant hand should now be \n\tapproaching your non-dominant hand. Make a throw from your non-dominant hand \n\tto clear space for the ball to be caught. Similarly, as the first ball you \n\tthrew from your non-dominant hand approaches your dominant hand, make a \n\tthrow from your dominant hand to clear space for that ball to be caught. \n\tThen catch the rest of the balls.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballcascadefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this step extensively. Once you are able to make and \n\tcatch all five throws in a controlled manner, you simply need to keep adding \n\tmore and more throws to the pattern as you become more and more comfortable. \n\tEventually, you will be able to make dozens of throws, at which point it is \n\tsafe to say that you are a five ball juggler. Of course, there is still a \n\tlong road ahead to achieving mastery of the Five Ball Cascade, as you begin \n\tto make hundreds and then even thousands of throws without dropping.</p>"

As such, the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade is probably \n\tone of the easiest tricks that can be done with five balls.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade, start with \n\ttwo balls in each hand. Make a split multiplex from your dominant hand such \n\tthat one ball travels across your body while the other ball stays roughly in \n\tline with your dominant hand. As the ball thrown across your body approaches \n\tyour non-dominant hand, and as the vertical ball from the multiplex \n\tapproaches your dominant hand, make a second, identical, multiplex from your \n\tnon-dominant hand, clearing space for you to catch that first ball.

While the animations \n\tin this tutorial all show the two balls being thrown at different heights, \n\tthis is a purely stylistic choice, as many jugglers throw both balls at \n\tequal heights. Once you can make these two multiplex throws consistently, it \n\tis time to add in the fifth ball. Start with three balls in your dominant \n\thand and two balls in your non-dominant. Make a single Cascade throw from \n\tyour dominant hand, and then make a split multiplex from your non-dominant \n\thand, clearing space for your hand to catch the first ball. As the ball from \n\tthat multiplex approaches your dominant hand, make a second split multiplex \n\tand catch that ball.

However, before catching the small throw made by your \n\tdominant hand (the throw made just before the horizontal pass), you are \n\tgoing to make a high throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your \n\tbody. This throw is a mirror image of the very first throw made by your \n\tnon-dominant hand. You will then catch the small throw with your now empty \n\tdominant hand.

Cross your dominant \n\thand over your non-dominant, then make a throw across your body from your \n\tdominant hand.

      "description": "     The Four Ball Stacked Box is a \n\tvariation of the Four Ball Box that can best be conceptualized as juggling a \n\tsmall Box underneath a much taller one. This pattern is sometimes referred \n\tto as just the<em> </em>Four Ball Box, but I arbitrarily chose to call \n\t(6,2x)(6,2x)* the Four Ball Box and therefore refer to this trick as the \n\tStacked variation. Terminology issues aside, the Four Ball Stacked Box is a \n\tfairly difficult pattern to learn due to an intense combination of speed and \n\taccuracy. <br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Four Ball Stacked Box, start with one \n\tball in each hand. Make a very high vertical throw from your dominant hand \n\twhile simultaneously making a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to \n\tyour dominant hand. As your dominant hand catches the passed ball you are \n\tgoing to throw that ball vertically at roughly the same height as you would \n\tif juggling the regular three ball Box pattern. This throw and the very high \n\tthrow should ideally peak at the same time. After catching the lower ball in \n\tyour dominant hand you are going to pass it back to your non-dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for your dominant hand to catch the very high ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxttwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides until the timing of all your \n\tthrows is comfortable and consistent. To add in the third ball start with \n\tone ball in your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Make \n\tthe same high vertical throw and horizontal pass combination that you did in \n\tstep one and then make the lower throw underneath it, except this time \n\tyou will also make a simultaneous horizontal pass from your non-dominant \n\thand to your dominant hand. If you were to freeze time you should see all \n\tthree balls on the dominant side of your body—one very high, one lower, and \n\tone in your hand. As the lower throw descends you will pass the ball in your \n\tdominant hand back to your non-dominant hand and then also pass the lower \n\tball back to your non-dominant hand to clear space for your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the very high ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. When you become comfortable \n\tenough with performing one cycle you will then want to combine the cycles on \n\teach side of your body. As you prepare to pass the second ball to your \n\tnon-dominant hand at the end of the cycle you will instead pair that pass with \n\ta very high vertical throw from your non-dominant hand, thereby setting you \n\tup to repeat the cycle on the other side of your body.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxthreecont.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Though the sequence of throws is somewhat different than \n\tthose of the Four Ball Stacked Box, this three ball exercise is still very \n\thelpful. To add in the fourth ball, start with two balls in each hand. Make \n\ta very high vertical throw from your dominant hand and then follow it up \n\twith a lower throw from your dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your \n\tnon-dominant hand. As the lower ball descends you are going to make a very \n\thigh throw from your non-dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand, followed by a lower throw from your non-dominant hand and a \n\tsecond pass from your dominant hand. You will then pass back the ball in \n\tyour non-dominant hand and catch both the very high throw and the lower \n\tthrow in your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    And that's pretty much all there is to it. To continue the \n\tpattern simply make another very high vertical throw from your dominant hand \n\talong with the last horizontal pass \n\tand the rest of the throws will fall into place. The Four Ball Stacked Box \n\trequires quick and precise throws, a combination that will likely take you a \n\tfair bit of time to master. </p>"

Theoretically \n\tthere are three different ways in which such a combination could be \n\tperformed, but in practice most jugglers make the \"5\" throw under-the-arm \n\tand then go from there. Unsurprisingly it is recommended that you already be \n\tcomfortable with both the 534 and Four Ball Mills Mess before attempting \n\tthis trick, though also knowing the 531 Mills Mess would probably help as \n\twell.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the 534 Mills Mess, start with two balls in \n\tyour dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant \n\tarm underneath your non-dominant arm, and then make a fairly high \n\tunder-the-arm throw from your dominant hand. Shortly after this throw is \n\tmade (before the ball reaches its peak), throw the ball in your non-dominant \n\thand as a fairly low Cascade throw toward the center of your body. After \n\tthat throw is made you will uncross and then begin to recross your arms. As \n\tyour dominant hand (which is still holding a ball) begins to recross over \n\tyour non-dominant hand the Cascade throw made by your non-dominant hand \n\tshould be descending. Make a medium (shorter than the first throw but higher \n\tthan the second) throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your \n\tbody, clearing space for your hand to catch the Cascade throw as it finishes \n\trecrossing. The high throw, now descending, will be caught under-the-arm by \n\tyour non-dominant hand, followed by the medium throw which will be caught by \n\tyour dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/534millsmessthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

Notice that you now have an extra ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand. Instead of simply waiting to catch the high throw you \n\twill instead make an under-the-arm high throw from your non-dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for it to catch the previous high throw. Catch the medium \n\tthrow with your dominant hand as you normally would, and then also catch the \n\tsecond high throw using your dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/534millsmessfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice that the \n\tfirst and last throw (the two high throws) are mirror images of each other. \n\tTo run the full pattern, make a short Cascade throw from your dominant hand \n\tbefore catching the medium throw. Then just repeat the other throws and \n\tcatches performed in the step above, this time using the opposite hand \n\tconfiguration. Connecting the two sides of the trick can be difficult, but \n\tunfortunately there is no way for a tutorial to really help; your body must \n\tsimply get used to it.  </p>"

Other jugglers began trying to recreate the \n\ttrick, and soon there were several variations of \"Dancey's Devilment\" \n\tfloating about. For this tutorial I have chosen the only variation where I \n\tcould find video documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Dancey's Devilment, start with two balls in \n\tyour non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Cross your \n\tnon-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand, and then make a stacked \n\tunder-the-arm multiplex. The top ball should be thrown roughly twice as high \n\tas the bottom ball, relative to the palm of your hand. As that bottom ball \n\treaches its peak, you are going to swing your dominant hand around and claw \n\tcatch it, uncrossing your arms as you do so. As the top multiplexed ball \n\tdescends, you are going to make a roughly vertical throw from the center of \n\tyour body (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your dominant side). \n\tYou will then catch the top multiplexed ball in your dominant hand and catch \n\tthe other ball with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/danceysdevilmentthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the fourth \n\tball, you are going to start with two balls in each hand. Cross your \n\tdominant hand over your non-dominant, but shift both hands toward the \n\tdominant side of your body. Make a vertical throw from your dominant hand \n\tand then, as the ball begins to descend, make the same stacked under-the-arm \n\tmultiplex done in the previous step from your non-dominant hand. This will \n\tclear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown from your \n\tdominant hand. As the bottom multiplexed ball reaches its peak, you are \n\tgoing to again swing your dominant hand around and claw catch it, uncrossing \n\tyour arms in the process. However, unlike in the previous step, you are \n\tgoing to continue circling your non-dominant hand (which is holding a ball) \n\tup and around as your dominant hand makes its center vertical throw. Your \n\tnon-dominant hand should cross back over your dominant hand just as your \n\tdominant hand is catching the top multiplexed ball. Your non-dominant hand \n\twill then circle underneath the center vertical ball, releasing the ball its \n\tholding and claw catching the center ball (as if juggling Rubenstein's \n\tRevenge). The ball it threw will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/danceysdevilmentfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides. This sequence \n\trepresents one cycle of Dancey's Devilment. To connect both sides of the \n\tpattern, you are simply going to make another stacked under-the-arm \n\tmultiplex, this time with your dominant hand (assuming you made the previous \n\tmultiplex with your non-dominant hand). You will then repeat the cycle on \n\tthe opposite side of your body. Assuming you are already fairly comfortable \n\twith multiplexes and Rubenstein's Revenge, Dancey's Devilment will not be \n\tthat difficult to learn.</span></p>"

      "description": "     The Four Ball Box is, as it \n\tsounds, a four \n\tball version of the Box pattern, which is normally juggled with three balls. \n\tHowever, the Four Ball Box differs from its little brother in two major \n\trespects. Unlike in the regular Box, horizontal passes do not simply \n\talternate direction, but instead occur in pairs, with two balls being tossed \n\tto the same hand sequentially. Similarly, the outside throws do not simply \n\tconsist of one ball thrown vertically, but instead follow a Three in \n\tOne-style trajectory, with two balls in the air at any given time. These \n\tdifferences make the Four Ball Box more complicated than the regular Box, \n\tthough the trick is still relatively easy compared to other four ball \n\tpatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Four Ball Box, it is best to begin with a \n\tsimpler three ball pattern. Start with two balls in your dominant hand and \n\tone ball in your non-dominant. Make two sequential throws from your dominant \n\thand, as if juggling the Three in One. As you are doing the second throw, \n\tmake a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. At \n\tthis point, all three balls should be on the dominant side of your body. As \n\tthe first ball thrown approaches your dominant hand, you are going to pass \n\tback the ball in that hand to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for you \n\tto catch the first ball, after which you will catch the second ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Since these throws form the core of the Four Ball Box, it is \n\timportant that you practice them extensively on both sides. Once your are \n\tproficient on each side, you can chain the two sides together. After you \n\tpass back the third ball to your non-dominant hand (the last throw of the \n\tprevious step), you are going to throw it up in air and repeat the same \n\tthrows done in the previous, except on the opposite side of your body. The \n\thorizontal passes should be made just after each ball from the previous step \n\treturns to your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxthree2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively. To add in the fourth ball, start \n\twith two balls in each hand. Make the same two vertical throws and \n\thorizontal pass that you did in step one,  and then, as the first ball \n\tapproaches your dominant hand, throw the ball in your non-dominant hand \n\tvertically and make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your \n\tnon-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first \n\tball. Immediately after the ball is caught, make another vertical throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand while also making a second pass to your non-dominant \n\thand using the ball that your dominant hand just caught. At this point, the \n\tlast vertical ball thrown from your dominant hand should be caught, and \n\tthere should be one ball in your non-dominant hand and two balls in the air \n\tabove it. As the first of those balls in the air descends toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand, make a pass back to your dominant hand and catch that \n\tball. Then catch the second ball that was in the air.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. To run the full Four Ball Box, \n\tjust make a vertical throw from your dominant hand as the non-dominant hand \n\tis passing back its ball at the end of the step show above.

The Four Ball \n\tMills Mess is significantly harder to learn the the regular Mills Mess, and \n\tit can take months of practice to achieve a clean and sustainable pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Four Ball Mills Mess, start with two \n\tballs in your dominant hand, and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross \n\tyour dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, and then make a throw from \n\tyour dominant hand in the direction of your non-dominant hand. As you are \n\tmaking that throw, uncross your arms, throwing the ball in your non-dominant \n\thand at the moment when your arms are fully uncrossed. That ball should \n\ttravel in the same direction as the first ball. Once that throw has been \n\tmade, recross your arms, this time with your non-dominant hand on top. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Up to this point, these throws and arm movements are \n\tidentical to the standard Mills Mess. There should be two balls in the air \n\tat this point, and the first ball should be close to your hands now. You \n\twill find yourself naturally wanting to catch the first ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand, which is now on top, since that most closely matches the \n\tthree ball Mills Mess. However, you must overcome that desire and instead \n\tthrow the last ball in your dominant hand under the arm of your dominant \n\thand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first ball. The \n\tsecond ball should be caught by your non-dominant hand, and the third ball \n\tshould be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively on both sides. As you likely \n\tnoticed, the balls don't actually switch hands, despite the arm movements. \n\tThis is an important thing to keep in mind; if you find that the balls are \n\tin fact switching hands, it is a definitive sign that you are doing \n\tsomething wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Once you have the above step mastered, it is time to add in \n\tthe fourth ball. Start with two balls in each hand, and then do the same \n\texact throws done in the previous step. However, when it comes time to catch \n\tthe second throw with your non-dominant hands, there should be, unlike in \n\tthe previous step, a ball in that hand. This ball is going to be thrown over \n\tthe second and third balls, and will travel in the opposite direction. Once \n\tthat ball has been thrown, catch the second ball as you uncross your arms \n\tand then catch the third and fourth balls.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. Once you have it mastered, it is \n\ttime to add in the fifth throw. Notice in the previous step that when the \n\tthird ball is caught, there is already a ball in that hand. For the next \n\tstep, your are going to make a throw from that hand in the same direction as \n\tthe fourth throw, and recross your hands, catching the fourth throw in your \n\tbottom hand and the fifth throw in your top hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessfive.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown in the animation, practice this on both sides. Now \n\tat this point, you may be able to figure out the rest of the pattern your \n\tself based on the rhythm of this step. However, if you are still confused, \n\tthere is one more individual throw to practice. The sixth throw is made to \n\tclear space for the fourth throw to be caught, and it is a full under the \n\tarm throw, going the same direction as the previous two throws.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmesssix.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Again, practice this on both sides. By this point, it would \n\tbe very surprising if your body didn't naturally pick up the rhythm of the \n\tpattern. However, just in case, the seventh throw is made from your top \n\thand, and signals the point where the pattern once again changes directions. \n\tAfter the seventh throw is made, your arms uncross as they make the eighth \n\tand ninth throws.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Running the full Four Ball Mills Mess for extended periods \n\ttakes a lot of practice, and is almost, but not quite as difficult as the \n\tFive Ball Cascade. And remember, the balls never switch hands, so always \n\twatch out for that as you practice.  </p>"

      "description": "     Cliff's Confusion is a four \n\tball multiplex pattern which resembles the three ball Mills Mess, but \n\tcontains an extra vertically-oriented split-multiplex in the middle of the \n\ttrick. I uncovered this obscure pattern from a\n\t<a href=\"http://www.toddstrong.com/\">website run by Todd Strong</a>. The \n\tanimation I found for Cliff's Confusion shows the pattern juggled in a \n\tslightly asymmetric fashion, with the multiplexes on one side of the body \n\tbeing thrown more vertically. I couldn't figure out if this was the proper \n\tform or simply an unconscious discrepancy, so I decided to focus on a \n\tsymmetric version (the original animation can be found by following the link \n\tin the \"Other Tutorials\" box). Regardless, it is easy to transition between \n\tthe two forms, so learning one variation will not hamper your mastery of the \n\tother.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Cliff's Confusion, start with two balls in each \n\thand. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then \n\tmake a vertical under-the-arm throw from your dominant hand. As that ball \n\treaches its peak, make a stacked multiplex throw from your non-dominant hand \n\ttoward the center for your body, clearing space for you to catch the first \n\tball with your non-dominant hand. As that ball is being caught, uncross your \n\tarms and then recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, \n\tcatching the bottom ball from the multiplex. The top ball will then be \n\tcaught by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/cliffsconfusionfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To connect the cycles, \n\tyou are going to add a third throw, made from your non-dominant hand, right \n\tas that hand is catching the top ball of the multiplex. This vertical throw \n\tsets you up for another multiplex, as shown in the animation below.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/cliffsconfusionfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have mastered this third throw, you simply need to \n\tkeep repeating the same multiplex/vertical throw pair that you practiced in \n\tstep one, and you will be juggling Cliff's Confusion.</p>"

The trick itself is simply a pair of Two-in-ones being juggled \n\tasynchronously (this pattern is technically called the Asynchronous \n\tFountain). Unlike many three ball tricks, the Fountain is generally not a \n\tpattern that can be simply \"figured out,\" and instead often requires a few \n\tweeks of practice to get mastered. Before you start learning the trick, it \n\tis important for you to be able to juggle a Two-in-One with each hand, and \n\tit helps to know the Half-Box (441).<br/>\n<br/>\n    The first step in juggling the Fountain is to practice with \n\tthree balls. Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and one in your \n\tother. Throw one ball from your dominant hand as if in a Two-in-one, and the \n\ttoss the ball in your other hand in a similar fashion. Once the first ball \n\thas almost returned to your dominant hand, throw the last ball up in the \n\tair, and then catch them all.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fountainthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this step extensively with both your dominant and \n\tnon-dominant hand leading. Remember, you will need to be able to maintain a \n\tTwo-in-one in each hand, so always practice with both hands equally. The \n\tnext step to learning the Fountain is a  four ball version of the step \n\tabove, with each ball being thrown once. Start with two balls in each hand. \n\tThen, throw one ball from your dominant hand, followed by one from your \n\tnon-dominant hand, followed by the other from your dominant hand, followed \n\tby the other ball in your non-dominant hand. Catch all the balls after these \n\tfour throws.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fountainfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this extensively. Make sure to do this \n\texerice starting with each hand. After you can do this step cleanly and \n\tconsistently, it is only a matter of increasing the number of throws, and \n\tyou will be juggling the Fountain. I would recommend adding just one or two \n\tthrows at a time for the first few cycles, then increasing the rate as you \n\tbecome more proficient. The Fountain is the backbone of many more advanced \n\tfour ball tricks, so it would be wise to invest a lot of time into mastering \n\tthis pattern.</p>"

Start with two \n\tballs in each hand, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your \n\tnon-dominant hand (you could cross them in the opposite configuration if you \n\twanted, but you will need to reverse the dominant and non-dominant hands \n\twhenever an instruction is given). Make a fairly vertical throw from your \n\tdominant hand, and then throw a stacked multiplex from your non-dominant \n\thand while simultaneously uncrossing your arms. You will then catch the \n\tlower multiplexed ball with your non-dominant hand, and then reach up and \n\tgrab the top multiplexed ball with your dominant hand as it begins to come \n\tback down.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltzone.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until your are comfortable with the two throws. \n\tTo add in the second cycle, you are going to make a throw from your dominant \n\thand as it reaches up to grab the top multiplexed ball. You will then make \n\tan under-the-arm stacked multiplex from your non-dominant hand, clearing \n\tspace for the ball just thrown from your dominant hand to be caught. You \n\twill then catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your non-dominant hand, and \n\tthen reach over and grab the top multiplexed ball with your dominant hand \n\t(just as you did for the previous cycle).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltztwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Again, practice these throws until you can do them \n\tconsistently. To add in the third and final cycle, you are going to make a \n\tthrow back across your body from your dominant hand while it is crossed over \n\tyour non-dominant hand. You will then catch the top multiplexed ball with \n\tyour empty dominant hand, which should be uncrossing. As the ball just \n\tthrown from your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you will \n\tmake a stacked multiplex from your non-dominant hand, clearing space for the \n\tball to be caught. You will catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your \n\tnon-dominant to catch the top multiplexed ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltzthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice all three of the cycles extensively. To begin a new \n\tset of cycles, you simply need to make an under-the-arm throw from your \n\tdominant hand before it catches the top multiplexed ball from the third \n\tcycle. This will set you up to make a multiplex from your non-dominant hand \n\tidentical to the one thrown in the first cycle. The Tennessee Waltz is not a \n\tparticularly difficult pattern, but it will take some practice to perfect \n\tthe multiplexes. </p>"

      "description": "     The Six Ball Fountain is, as it \n\tsounds, the six ball version of the Fountain. It is the base pattern of six \n\tball juggling, and therefore an important milestone in one's juggling \n\tcareer. Like the Five Ball Cascade, the Six Ball Fountain is very difficult \n\tand time consuming to learn, and only with dedicated practice can it be \n\tmastered. Given that one does not simply learn the Six Ball Fountain in a \n\tday, and seeing as how the pattern is in fact quite simple in principle, \n\tthis tutorial will only be able to offer basic advice to help you along.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Before attempting the Six Ball Fountain it is very important \n\tthat you already be fairly comfortable with the Three in One using <strong>\n\tboth</strong> hands. While outright mastery isn't really necessary, you \n\tshould at least be able to perform runs of 15-20 catches with good \n\tconsistency.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threeinone.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    When you first start practicing the Six Ball Fountain it is \n\tmost helpful to begin with a flash, which means you will throw and catch \n\teach ball once. It is important that you take time to really focus on this \n\tstep as it will provide you with a solid foundation for when you try to add \n\tmore throws. When performing the flash make sure that the balls are staying \n\ton their respective sides and not crossing through the center, and that the \n\ttiming feels roughly balanced (it's okay if it isn't perfect).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/6balltricks/sixballfountainsix.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you are comfortable with the flash you can begin to add \n\tin more throws. Now this is where different juggling paradigms come into \n\tconflict a bit. Some jugglers argue that you should engage in highly \n\tstructured practice, adding in only one or two throws at a time then \n\tpurposefully stopping. Others say that you should just try to juggle the \n\tpattern for as long as possible, only stopping when you drop a ball. Both of \n\tthese approaches have some merit, so I personally recommend a compromise \n\tmethod. You should not stop juggling based on a particular number of throws, \n\tbut instead stop when the pattern becomes unstable. For the Six Ball \n\tFountain this usually means when throws from different hands begin crossing \n\tover each other. Not only does this allow you more flexibility but it also \n\tallows you to practice collecting all six balls at the end of a run.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Unfortunately there isn't much more to say. The Six Ball \n\tFountain is not a very hard pattern to figure out, but it can be grueling to \n\tlearn. Progress will likely be slower than for the Five Ball Cascade, but \n\tnot extremely so—just try to remember that the world of six ball juggling \n\tis waiting for you.</p>"

This makes the \n\tpattern awkward to juggle, while also providing an interesting aesthetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Underarm Shower, start with one ball in each \n\thand.

After making the drop you will swing your \n\tnon-dominant hand around and under your dominant hand, catching the dropped \n\tball (as was done in step one). At the same time your dominant hand will \n\tmake a vertical throw along the center of your body, clearing space for it \n\tto catch the ball it threw. This catch and the catching of the dropped ball \n\tshould happen at the same time. The center ball will then be caught by your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"440\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmfactorythree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. For the final step, \n\tyou are going to uncross your arms after the simultaneous catches at the end \n\tof previous step are made. As the center ball descends you will make a \n\tvertical throw from your non-dominant hand along the non-dominant side of \n\tyour body, clearing space for that hand to catch the center ball. The \n\toutside ball will then also be caught by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmfactoryfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides. Notice how the last \n\ttwo throws (the center and outside vertical throws) of the previous step are \n\tmirror images of the first two throws. To perform the full trick, simply \n\traise the ball in your dominant hand up so that it remains horizontally \n\taligned with the outside ball thrown from your non-dominant hand, and then \n\trepeat the the same throws and catches of the previous step with your hands \n\treversed. The Crossed-Arm Factory, because of its odd ball drop, will take \n\tsome time to perfect, though the core pattern itself is fairly easy to \n\tfigure out. </p>"

      "description": "\n     \nThe Takearound is an asymmetric variation of the Takeouts pattern (one the most popular 423 mess patterns) in which each hand\nhandles the siteswap 2 differently. One hand performs a normal takeout carry around the pattern, while the other hand, in lieu of a\ntakeout, has the considerably more difficult task of a dropped active 2 while crossed over on the other side of the juggler's body,\nand while also contending with the path of the other arm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    \nIn this pattern each ball plays a unique role (so it may be helpful to learn it with three differently colored balls).\nThe focal point and inspiration of the pattern name is the takearound 4/2 ball, which is only touched by the dominant hand. Its path is\na vertical 4 on the opposite side of the body, caught close to its peak, and then a swooping 2 up and around the pattern, ending up at the\npoint where it started for the next 4 throw. The other 4/2 ball, touched only by the other hand, stays in a vertical column on the\nopposite side of the body. The 4 throw for this ball is essentially the same as for the takearound \n\tball, although it is caught a little lower. The first part of the 2 is a slight carry upward, \n\tafter which the ball is dropped and subsequently caught by the same hand. It is\nthen quickly thrown back up as the next 4. Meanwhile, the siteswap 3 ball is thrown vertically \n\talong the center of the pattern and the\njuggler's torso, alternating hands with each catch Unlike the other two balls, it does not have a particularly interesting life story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/takearoundtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n     \nTo start learning this pattern, study the simple two ball exercise above. Disregarding the siteswap 3 ball for the moment, work on the\nmechanics and timing of the two 4/2 balls. Once you feel comfortable with this, you can add in the third ball.<br/>\n<br/>\n    \n\tStart with two balls in your dominant \n\thand and the third\nball in your non-dominant hand. First, throw the takearound ball straight up \n\twith your dominant hand from a crossed position\nunderneath the opposite arm. The second ball is then dropped from your non-dominant hand, \n\tafter which you will whip that same hand around to catch it and end up\nwith your dominant arm crossed over your non-dominant arm. As you catch the dropped ball with your non-dominant hand, your dominant hand \n\twill throw the third ball up in a central column and then reach up to catch \n\tthe first ball. The second ball is then thrown up vertically by your \n\tnon-dominant hand, allowing it to catch the third ball, while your dominant \n\thand carries the first ball around the pattern. To reset, pass the third\nball into your dominant hand as it reaches the end of its arc, and catch the second ball in your non-dominant hand, crossing over your dominant\narm.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/takearoundthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    \nAdding more cycles of the pattern should be relatively straightforward once you have mastered the previous exercises.\nThe continuous Takearound pattern is relatively challenging, but quite fun to juggle.<br>\n<br/>\n<strong>Tutorial created and submitted by Andrew Olson. </strong>\n</br></p>"

The only \n\tdifference is that instead of making the horizontal pass underneath the \n\tpattern, the Shuffle makes the pass through it (Slam throw). Knowing this, \n\tit would be best to start out by learning Slams. Start with one ball in each \n\thand. From your non-dominant hand, you are going to throw one ball across \n\tyour body. Then bring your dominant hand down on top of it, throwing the \n\tball currently in that hand downward to your non-dominant hand, and catching \n\tthe first ball:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/shufflefirststep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tPractice this a lot!

For the \n\tnext step, you are going to use three balls—one ball in your dominant hand, \n\ttwo in your non-dominant. Throw one ball from from your non-dominant hand, \n\tand wait for it to reach the peak of its path (like in step one). Then, you \n\tare going to throw the second ball in your non-dominant hand, and then \n\timmediately after you are going to make a Slam throw with your dominant \n\thand: <br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/shufflesecondstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tLike many other tricks, the Shuffle is all about timing. Practice this \n\tsecond step until you you can perform it smoothly without dropping. After \n\tthat you simply keep adding in extra throws. Start with two, practice, and \n\tthen move on to three. Gradually—and I do emphasize the word gradually—you \n\twill start being able to run the Shuffle longer and longer. It is also worthwhile to learn the Shuffle using your non-dominant hand, as the Slam \n\tthrow is used in tricks that require both hands. </p>"

      "description": "     Olas is a rare but impressive \n\ttrick established by <span><a href=\"http://www.olalofberg.se/aqua/fintro.html\">\n\tOla Löfberg</a></span> that utilizes a unique revolving catch along with \n\tquick multiplexes to create one of the most unique juggling patterns. Unfortunately, \n\tdue to its lack of mention in most juggling guides, Olas is a trick known to \n\trelatively few jugglers, particularly when compared to patterns like the Mills \n\tMess and Rubenstein's Revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Olas, it is best to break the trick down into two \n\tbasic components, the catch and the multiplex. The odd revolving catch of \n\tOlas is best learned by starting with two balls in your non-dominant hand. \n\tThrow one into the air, as if in a Cascade pattern, and then claw catch it \n\twith your dominant hand. Right as that catch is made, throw the the second \n\tball, and swing you dominant hand back around and claw catch that ball as \n\twell.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olastwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n        Practice this catch until it is \n\tsecond nature with both hands. The second part of Olas is the multiplex \n\tthrow, which may take some practice to master. If you aren't already \n\tfamiliar with a multiplex throw, it is a throw in which you release two \n\tballs simultaneously. In this case, one ball will be passed straight into \n\tthe other hand, while the second ball will be thrown to the other side as if \n\tin a normal Cascade. Before any of this happens, you will also be making a \n\tnormal cascade throw with a ball in the other hand, which will travel over \n\tthe two multiplexed balls.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasmulti.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Again, practice this portion until you can perform it \n\tsmoothly and consistently. Now that you have learned both components, it is \n\ttime to put them together. Start by juggling a regular Cascade (this is the \n\teasiest way to transition into Olas), and then make a claw catch on one of \n\tthe balls using your dominant and then do a revolving catch of the next \n\tball. You should now have two balls in you dominant hand, and one ball in \n\tthe other. Throw that ball out of your non-dominant hand as if in a Cascade, \n\tand then perform a multiplex with the two balls in your dominant hand, just \n\tlike in the animation above. Resume a normal Cascade afterward.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasrun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have mastered this pattern on both sides (as shown \n\tin the animation), it is only a matter of removing the extra Cascade throws \n\tin the middle, and you are juggling Olas. Instead of returning to a Cascade \n\tafter the multiplex, you are instead going to toss the passed ball back \n\tacross your body, and then claw catch the more lofty multiplex throw. Using \n\ta revolving catch, you are going to then grab the ball thrown from your \n\tother hand, and then multiplex again out of that end, repeating the pattern \n\ton the other side of your body. If you are having a hard time visualizing \n\tthe continuation, watch the animation below closely, \n\tpaying particular attention to what happens after the multiplex throw (the \n\tballs are colored for added clarity).<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasslow.gif\" width=\"400\"/>  </p>"

As that \n\tvertical throw from your non-dominant hand begins to descend (it should be \n\tlocated on the dominant side of your body), make a vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand along with a horizontal pass from your dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for your dominant hand to catch that descending vertical \n\tball.

That being said the \n\tHigh-Low Shower is still a fairly easy pattern overall, and is quite fun to \n\tjuggle.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the High-Low Shower start with two balls in \n\tyour dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Make a very high throw \n\tfrom your dominant hand toward your non-dominant hand and then quickly \n\tfollow it up with a lower throw in the same direction followed by a horizontal \n\tpass from your non-dominant hand.

As such, the Boston Shuffle can \n\tserve as practice for the Shuffle, but can also be learned more quickly if \n\tyou already know the Shuffle beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To start learning the Boston Shuffle, you first need to be \n\table to do slam throws on each side. Hold one ball in each hand, and then \n\tmake a Cascade throw with your non-dominant hand. Then, raise your dominant \n\thand up over the thrown ball, and make a downward pass with the held ball, \n\tcatching it in your non-dominant hand, and then claw catch the first ball \n\twith your dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshuffletwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this slam throw on both sides until your are very \n\tcomfortable with it. To add in the third ball, start by juggling a normal \n\tCascade pattern. Then, make a slam throw with your dominant hand, throwing \n\tthe ball in your non-dominant hand as an overthrow to clear space for the \n\tdownward pass.

The final step to learning the Boston Shuffle is \n\tto chain one slam together with a slam from the opposite side. Start by \n\tjuggling a normal Cascade, then make a slam throw and overthrow like in the \n\tprevious step. However, instead of going back into the Cascade, you are \n\tgoing to immediately make a single Cascade throw using the hand which had \n\tjust done a slam, and then perform another slam using your other hand. After \n\tthe last slam, return to the normal Cascade.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshufflerun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have mastered two slams, try a third, fourth, fifth, \n\tand so on until you are running the Boston Shuffle continuously. This pattern \n\tis not particularly complicated, but the accuracy required for the slam \n\tthrows will take some time to acquire. If performed correctly, each ball \n\tshould travel along a single path (e.g. only one ball should ever be \n\tslammed), so it may help to use easily distinguishable balls when \n\tpracticing.</p>"

Instead \n\tof making a fake toss with one of your hands (as done in the original \n\tGeorgian Shuffle), you make an actual throw, under which you perform the \n\tmultiplex. Beyond that, the two Georgian Shuffles are pretty similar, except \n\tthe inside multiplexed ball is grabbed by the hand that didn't throw it \n\t(i.e. the hand that made the first throw) in the symmetrical variation.\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n    Before attempting the Symmetric Georgian Shuffle, it is \n\timportant that you already be able to juggle the normal Georgian Shuffle on \n\tboth sides of your body (i.e. you are able to juggle the pattern with either \n\thand making the multiplex). To begin learning the Symmetric Georgian \n\tShuffle, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your \n\tnon-dominant. Make a normal Cascade-style throw from your non-dominant hand, \n\tand then cross your dominant hand to the non-dominant side of your body \n\t(your non-dominant hand can either be brought to the outside or up against \n\tyour chest to move it out of the way). Make a split-multiplex throw from \n\tyour dominant hand, and then catch the Cascade throw with your now empty \n\tdominant hand. As the multiplexed balls reach their peak, pluck the inside \n\tball out of the air using your non-dominant hand, and then cross your \n\tdominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand to catch the outside ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianshufflethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. To add in the final throw, run \n\tthrough the same throws and catches made in the previous step, but add in an \n\tunder-the-arm vertical throw along the outside of the outer multiplexed ball \n\tusing your dominant hand, which will then catch the multiplexed ball. As \n\tthat outside vertical throw begins to descend, take your non-dominant hand, \n\twhich should have just grabbed the inside multiplexed ball, and swing it \n\tover and around the outside ball, catching it as the ball descends.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianshufflefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this step on both sides. You have just \n\tcompleted one cycle of the Symmetric Georgian Shuffle. To run the full \n\tpattern, simply make another Cascade-style throw (with your opposite hand \n\tthis time) slightly before the outside vertical throw is caught by your \n\tother hand. This will set you up to make another multiplex throw, after \n\twhich the cycle simply continues. </p>"

Before attempting Relf's Revenge it is important that you \n\talready be fairly comfortable with Rubenstein's Revenge, but no experience \n\twith Relf's Revenge is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n     To begin learning Relf's Revenge 6, start with one ball \n\tin your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Raise your \n\tdominant hand up to about shoulder height, and then shift both of your hands \n\tto the center of your body such that your non-dominant hand is positioned \n\tunder your dominant hand. Make a roughly vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your \n\tnon-dominant side) while simultaneously swinging your dominant hand under \n\tand around the thrown ball. As the ball peaks, your dominant hand should be \n\tcircling over it; you will then throw the ball in your dominant hand over \n\ttoward the non-dominant side of your body and claw-catch the first ball. So \n\tfar this should all feel pretty similar to Rubenstein's Revenge. After the \n\tclaw-catch you will then swing your dominant hand in a \"C\" shape toward the \n\tdominant side of your body while making a throw from your non-dominant \n\thand—the throw will be made from the center of your body toward your \n\tdominant side, but it should be mostly vertical. This will clear space for \n\tyour non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown by your dominant hand. Your \n\tdominant hand will then, after completing its \"C\"-shaped flourish, catch the \n\tball thrown from your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevenge6three.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Instead of simply letting the ball descend into your \n\tnon-dominant hand, you are going to reach up and claw-catch it. You will \n\tthen continue the downward motion of the claw-catch while simultaneously \n\tmaking a throw from your dominant hand that mirrors the very first throw you \n\tmade; this will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the ball your \n\tnon-dominant hand had thrown (the last throw of the previous step). You will \n\tthen swing your non-dominant hand around and under the ball just thrown by \n\tyour dominant hand before finally claw-catching it. You should end up with \n\ttwo balls in your non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevenge6full.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

Then catch the two \n\tother balls with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzlethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. As with the previous step, once \n\tyou have one cycle of this step mastered, you will want to do the pattern \n\tcontinuously to maximize its instructional impact. Instead of stopping after \n\tmaking the horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand (after which the \n\tanimation shown above simply catches the rest of the balls), you are going \n\tto follow it up with a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand, allowing \n\tthe whole cycle to repeat again and form one continuous pattern.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzlefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As you may have noticed, this pattern contains all the throws \n\tpresent in the full Triazzle, lacking only the side-to-side arm movements. \n\tTo add them in, perform the pattern shown above and then, as you make a \n\tvertical throw from one hand, cross your other hand underneath the throwing \n\thand. As the vertical ball descends and the throwing hand tosses its other ball, \n\tuncross your other hand and continue the pattern.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/triazzlefull2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. To run the full Triazzle, simply \n\tmake those arm motions after every vertical throw. For such a simply \n\tpattern, it may take a surprising amount of practice to achieve true \n\tproficiency, since the pattern uses a wide variety of throws and movements.  </p>"

Simultaneously, throw the ball in your \n\tdominant hand vertically such that the first ball will pass over it. Now \n\tthat your dominant hand is empty, you can raise it up to catch the first \n\tball.

Cross your non-dominant hand over your dominant hand and then rotate \n\tyour non-dominant hand so that your palm is facing downward. Then make a fairly \n\thigh throw from your dominant hand along the center of your body while basically dropping the ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand (you should still give the ball a bit of upward movement). In \n\tthe same motion you are going to uncross and then recross your arms such \n\tthat your dominant hand is on top, catching the \"dropped\" ball with your \n\tdominant hand as it recrosses. The high ball will then be caught \n\tunder-the-arm by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/katoscruxtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

If done \n\tcorrectly, this ball should be caught before the other ball reaches its \n\tpeak. As that other ball descends, move your dominant back down and catch \n\tit.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    This aerial catch will likely feel very awkward at first, but \n\twith practice you will eventually master the timing. To add in the next \n\tthrow, you are going to again start with one ball in each hand, and then \n\tperform the same vertical throws and catches you did in previous step. This \n\ttime however, you are also going to throw the ball you caught in the air \n\tover to the other side of your body. This will clear space for your dominant \n\thand to catch the other vertical ball. As the ball that was caught and then \n\tthrown by your dominant hand reaches the other side of your body, bring your \n\tnon-dominant hand up and catch it.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxtwo2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this until you feel comfortable with the \n\tthrows. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your non-dominant \n\thand and one ball in your dominant. Make the same throws and catches as in \n\tthe previous step, but this time make a vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand before using it to catch the ball in the air (this happens \n\tafter your dominant hand catches and then throws that same ball). As a \n\tgeneral rule, all vertical throws made in this pattern should be the same \n\theight. As that last vertical throw reaches its peak and begins to descend \n\t(your non-dominant hand should have just caught the ball in the air), you \n\tare going to drop the ball from your non-dominant hand and then bring it \n\tback down to catch the vertical throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The step described above contains all the throws and catches \n\tperformed in the air, which together make up the primary pattern. However, \n\tto connect the various cycles, you will also need perform a normal \n\thorizontal pass/vertical throw combination. To add this in, you are going to \n\trepeat the process from the previous step, and then, as the ball that has \n\tbeen in the air the entire time begins to finally descend toward your \n\tdominant hand, you will make a vertical throw from your dominant hand. This \n\twill clear space for that hand to catch the other ball. As the ball just \n\tthrown begins to descend, you are going to make a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand and a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (this throw \n\tshould be made close to the center of your body).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The animation above demonstrates one full cycle of the True \n\tBox.

For the third step, you are \n\tstill going to start with one ball in each hand. But this time you are going \n\tto make one overthrow, then one pass (like in step one), then overthrow the \n\tball you just passed, catch the first ball in your other hand, make a pass, \n\tand catch the second ball in that same hand:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/showerthirdstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tLike the other two steps, you are going to want to get very comfortable with \n\tthese throws.

For the final step, you are going to start with \n\tthree balls—two in your dominant hand, one in your non-dominant. You are \n\tgoing to make one overthrow from your dominant hand, then make a second one \n\tusing the other ball from that hand. Just as that second ball is leaving, \n\tyou are going to make a pass using the third ball in your non-dominant hand. \n\tIf you timed it right, the first ball should land in your non-dominant right \n\tafter you make the pass, thus allowing you to keep repeating the cycle:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/showerfinalstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tAnd there you have it. To continue the pattern, you just keep making a pass \n\teach time a ball is heading towards your non-dominant hand. After you have \n\tthe Shower pattern solid, you can reverse directions and make overthrows \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand. I would highly recommend doing this, because it \n\thelps prepare both your hands for making consistent horizontal passes, which will occur in \n\tpatterns like the Box. You can also add more balls into the pattern (four \n\tand five ball Showers are quite common), the only difference is that your \n\tthrows must be higher and faster.</p>"

      "description": "<span class=\"style2\">    The Three Ball Cascade is the most \n\tbasic juggling pattern, and the first trick any would-be juggler should \n\tlearn. The Cascade is generally considered to be the easiest pattern, and \n\tforms the backbone of many other tricks. <br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"178\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/oneball_50000.gif\" style=\"float: right\" width=\"192\"/>    To begin learning the pattern, it is important to make sure you are \n\tcomfortable with throwing and catching a ball. It sounds silly, I know, but \n\twhen first starting to juggle I found that my left hand (non-dominant) had a \n\thard time accurately throwing the ball to my right. You will want to get \n\tvery comfortable throwing the ball from you dominant hand to your \n\tnon-dominant, and vice versa. Try to keep the height of the throws a little \n\tbit above your head. Once you have mastered this, you are ready to move on \n\tto the next step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tIt is at this second step that most jugglers begin dropping (short hand way \n\tto say that you have failed to catch your ball) a lot. As such, this is \n\tprobably a good time to remind you that using tennis balls on a hard floor \n\tis not the best way to juggle. For beginners, I would highly recommend \n\tgetting some good quality bean bags\n\t<a href=\"http://www.dube.com/beanbag/4-panel-juggling-beanbags.php\">such as \n\tthese ones from Dube</a>. They are soft, don't bounce or roll (much), and \n\tare quite easy to catch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t    Now that you have the proper juggling equipment, it is \n\ttime to add in the second ball. This second ball is going to travel through \n\tthe air with a similar trajectory as the first ball, except it is going to \n\tbe thrown underneath that first ball, and travel in a different direction.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"168\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/twoballcascade.gif\" width=\"168\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tTo start, hold a ball in each hand, and then throw one ball up in the same \n\ttrajectory as step one. As that ball reaches it peak, you are going to throw \n\tthe second ball up underneath it towards your other hand (the one that threw \n\tthe first ball), then catch them both. You are going to want to make sure \n\tthat you practice throwing the first ball from both hands. If that description confuses you, \n\tjust focus on the animation above and try to copy its throws. This pattern \n\tis known as the Two Ball Cascade.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t    You \n\tmust make sure not to pass the second ball horizontally to your other hand \n\t(shown below), \n\tas this is the way people often intuitively try and juggle two balls.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle3\" height=\"136\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/incorrect.gif\" width=\"156\"/><br/>\n\t    Once you are able to juggle two balls correctly without \n\tmuch trouble, you are ready to add in the third ball. The first pattern to \n\tlearn with three balls is the flash, where every ball is thrown up and then \n\tcaught again like so.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle4\" height=\"168\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/3ballflash.gif\" width=\"167\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tThe flash is very similar to the Two Ball Cascade, except you sneak in a \n\tthird toss during the pause that occurs after you throw the first two balls. \n\tWhile the timing of this trick is slightly different than the standard Three \n\tBall Cascade (notice there is still a period of time where all three balls \n\tare in the air), practicing the flash will improve your accuracy and throw \n\tspeed. Once you can do the Three Ball Flash reliably without too many drops, \n\tyou are ready to move onto the final step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t    For the final step in learning the Three Ball Cascade, \n\tyou will be combining all the skills learned thus far. Starting with three \n\tballs (two in your dominant hand), you are going two throw your first ball, \n\tand wait for it to reach its peak. Then you will throw the ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand, allowing for the first ball to land in your now empty \n\thand. Once that second ball reaches its peak, you will throw the third ball \n\tfrom your dominant hand, clearing room for the second ball to be caught. And \n\tso the cycle continues, each time a ball reaches its peak, another one is \n\tthrown, freeing up a hand to catch the first ball. The animation below shows \n\tthe pattern being run for five throws and catches.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle5\" height=\"167\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/runoffive.gif\" width=\"166\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tNow that you have the basic pattern down, the only thing you have left to do \n\tis practice, practice, practice! When it comes down to it, that's all \n\tjuggling is.

      "description": "     Relf's Factory is a variation \n\tof the Factory pattern in which a circular arm flourish is added before each \n\tdrop. This gives a more flowing and smooth aesthetic to the otherwise \n\tangular Factory, while also adding in some complexity and difficulty. Before \n\tattempting Relf's Factory it is of course important that you already be very \n\tcomfortable juggling the regular Factory, and it might also help to know \n\tMangham's Mangle.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Relf's Factory, start with two balls in \n\tyour non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand. Swing your \n\tdominant hand up and around in a circle while simultaneously making a fairly \n\tshort two-in-one throw from your non-dominant hand. The throw should occur \n\tat roughly the same time that your dominant hand is on the non-dominant side \n\tof your body, so the throw will be made under-the-arm. As the thrown ball \n\tpeaks your dominant hand should move underneath it and then back up to \n\troughly where the circle started. You will then make a second throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand, this time a crossing throw toward the dominant side \n\tof your body, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the first \n\tball it threw. Your dominant hand, having just finished its circle, will \n\tthen shift horizontally over to the non-dominant side of your body such that \n\tit arrives right as the crossing throw peaks. You will then bring the hand \n\tback down to catch the crossing throw.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsfactorythree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step you \n\tare going to drop the ball from your dominant hand after it finishes its \n\thorizontal shift. You will then use your now empty dominant hand to snatch \n\tthe crossing ball (thrown by your non-dominant hand) as it peaks and begins \n\tto descend. This is essentially identical to what occurs in the regular \n\tFactory. As your dominant hand is snatching its ball you will simultaneously \n\tmake a second crossing throw, roughly identical to the first, from your \n\tnon-dominant hand. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch \n\tthe ball that your dominant hand just dropped. You will then bring your \n\tdominant hand down to catch the second crossing throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsfactoryfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again you should practice this on both sides as shown. \n\tYou have just completed one full cycle of Relf's Factory. To continue the \n\tpattern simply make a two-in-one style throw from your dominant hand while \n\tsimultaneously starting a circular arm flourish with your non-dominant hand \n\t(this is basically just a mirror image of how you started the first cycle), \n\tand then repeat the whole process again. Relf's Factory is not a very hard \n\tpattern, so if you are looking for an easy way to spice up the regular \n\tFactory then this is a good choice.</p>"

      "description": "     The Crossed-Arm Shower is, as \n\tits name suggests, a variation of the Shower pattern in which your arms are \n\tcrossed. The overall shape of the pattern is virtually unchanged (though \n\tusually smaller), so conceptually the trick is fairly simple. The main \n\tdifficulty comes from learning how to make horizontal passes from a \n\tcrossed-arm position—a very unusual throw type not present in most juggling \n\ttricks. The hand that throws these passes can be crossed over or \n\tunder, but for this tutorial I am going to consider the crossed-over form as \n\tstandard, and the crossed-under form as the \"Reverse Variation.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Crossed-Arm Shower, start with one ball \n\tin your dominant hand and then cross your arms such that your dominant arm \n\tis on top. Without uncrossing your arms, make a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand to your non-dominant hand. You will want to make this a \n\tforceful throw along a straight line—the ball should not be lightly tossed, \n\tas might be your first instinct.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowerone.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until the throw feels natural. Unlike in the \n\tanimation, you could also practice passing the ball back from the hand \n\tcrossed under, as it is the quickest way to return the ball to your dominant \n\thand. To add in the second ball, you are going to start with one ball in \n\teach hand and your arms crossed in the same configuration as before. You \n\twill then perform an under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand toward \n\tyour dominant hand while simultaneously making a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand to your non-dominant hand (as was practiced in the first \n\tstep), catching the under-the-arm throw with your now empty dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowertwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively. Next, we are going to extend the \n\tsecond step such that, after making its first under-the-arm throw, your \n\tnon-dominant hand will make another throw using the ball passed by your \n\tdominant hand. Your dominant hand will then catch the first under-the-arm \n\tthrow and quickly pass it back to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for \n\tyour dominant hand to catch the second throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowertworun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can do all of the throws comfortably \n\tand consistently. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your \n\tnon-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand. Cross your arms in the \n\tsame configuration as before, then make an under-the-arm throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand. As that ball peaks and begins to descend, you will \n\tmake a second throw from your non-dominant hand while simultaneously passing \n\tthe ball in your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. This will clear \n\tspace for your dominant hand to catch the first under-the-arm throw. Your \n\tdominant hand will then also catch the second ball thrown from your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowerthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As always, practice this step until you are comfortable with \n\tit. To continue the pattern, simply make another pass/under-the-arm-throw \n\tcombination and then keep adding them in as you become more proficient. The \n\tCrossed-Arm Shower is an enjoyable pattern in its own right, but its real \n\tvalue lies in unlocking three ball tricks that utilize a crossed-arm \n\thorizontal pass (e.g. non-standard versions of the 441 and 531 Mills Mess). </p>"

The first throw is particularly unusual, \n\tsince you are almost dropping the ball as you raise your over it hand to \n\tgrab the diagonal pass. To practice this part of the trick, start with two \n\tballs, one in each hand. From you non-dominant hand, you are going to toss a \n\tball upward diagonally toward your other side, while at the same time \n\traising your dominant hand. As you lift that hand, you are going to drop its \n\tball, which should continue to fly upwards for a short while due to inertia. \n\tYou will then catch the first ball with your now empty dominant hand, and \n\tthen quickly slam it back down to your other hand, claw catching the second \n\tball as your dominant hand moves back down.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/nboxtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this over and over until you can execute it smoothly \n\tand consistently.

Then, throw a ball up from \n\tyour non-dominant hand diagonally toward the your other side, and then \n\texecute the unique throw and catch sequence in the previous step, slamming \n\tthe ball back to your non-dominant hand.

This \n\ttrick is one of the most difficult Box variations, since the \"passes\" \n\trequire accuracy and careful timing to work effectively.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Karas's Box, start with one ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand. Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant \n\thand, and then make a very low throw from your non-dominant hand toward the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body.

Start by juggling the regular Box, and then transition into \n\tthe Bizarre Box by making a \"pass\" from an uncrossed position into a \n\tcrossed-arm position. In the Bizarre Box, you would then carry the passed \n\tball back around as you uncrossed your arms.

It combines simultaneous vertical throws with revolving arm \n\tmotions to create a unique juggling aesthetic. Nelson's Nemesis is not a \n\tparticularly difficult pattern, but its throws might be slightly confusing \n\tat first.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Nelson's Nemesis, start with two balls in your \n\tnon-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Make one vertical throw \n\tfrom each hand simultaneously (as if doing Columns), and then bring your \n\tdominant hand up and grab the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand at its \n\tpeak. Let the other ball begin to descend, and then reach your non-dominant \n\thand (which is still holding a ball) over across your body to the outside \n\tand make a vertical throw. This will clear space for you to catch the other \n\tvertical ball. Then catch the last ball with your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/nelsonsnemesisthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. Once you have these \n\ttwo synchronous throws mastered, the only thing left to learn is the arm \n\tflourish. In the previous step, you may have noticed that after the second \n\tball has been caught and the third ball has been thrown, there is a period \n\tof time where both hands are idle. Instead of just having your arms sit \n\tthere, you are going bring your dominant hand (which at this point has just \n\tgrabbed one of the vertical balls) up and around the center of your body. \n\tOnce your non-dominant hand has caught the other vertical ball (right after \n\tthrowing the third ball), it too will be swung around the center of your \n\tbody in a circle. This flourish should be practically identical to the one \n\tperformed in Rubenstein's Revenge. Once your dominant hand has circled down \n\tto the center of your body, you are going to make a roughly vertical throw. \n\tIf timed correctly, your dominant hand should then be free to catch the \n\tthird ball. The last ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/nelsonsnemesisfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

To start a \n\tnew cycle of the pattern, make another pair of simultaneous throws, catching \n\tthe last vertical ball in the same hand that threw it (in this case, your \n\tdominant hand). You will then reach up and grab one of the vertical balls \n\tand make the same set of throws as done in the previous steps, using the \n\topposite hand for each throw. If you are having trouble figuring out the \n\tthrows of Nelson's Nemesis, watch the full trick animation at the top of \n\tthis page very closely, making sure to track each individual ball throughout \n\tthe pattern.</p>"

      "description": "     The Icelandic Shuffle is a \n\tthree ball pattern that I believe was established by\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/circusbj\">Beejay Joyer</a>. It can \n\tbasically be seen as an asymmetric variation of the Kraken, in which one \n\tball is carried around the pattern in order to set up the next cycle. Like \n\tthe Kraken, the Icelandic Shuffle uses midair stalls, though it has \n\ta more uneven pace than its symmetric counterpart.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Icelandic Shuffle, start with two balls \n\tin your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your arms \n\tsuch that your dominant hand is underneath your non-dominant hand, and then \n\tmake a vertical throw from your dominant hand. Immediately after, throw the ball in your non-dominant hand straight up, and then continue the \n\tupward motion of your hand and direct it toward the ball thrown from your \n\tdominant hand. You will claw catch the ball with your non-dominant hand \n\t(leaving it suspended in midair), and \n\tthen make a vertical throw along the center of your body using your dominant \n\thand, clearing space for that hand to catch the ball thrown from your \n\tnon-dominant hand. You will then release the ball in your non-dominant hand \n\t(which is being held in the air), and claw catch the the center ball as it \n\treaches its peak and begins to descend. The ball you released will be caught \n\tby your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Next, you are going to change the way you catch the final \n\tball of the previous step. Instead of simply crossing your dominant hand and \n\tcatching the ball as it descends, you are going to make a throw from your \n\tdominant hand on the dominant side of your body toward the center of your \n\tbody, and then cross your dominant hand over and claw catch the other ball \n\tout of the air (the ball you simply let fall into your dominant hand at the \n\tend of the previous step). As the ball thrown from your dominant hand travels \n\ttoward the center of your body, you are going to make a throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand underneath that ball, toward the dominant side of your \n\tbody. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball \n\tthrown from your dominant hand. You will then also catch the ball thrown \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflenext.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Notice in the animation above that one of the hands (your \n\tdominant hand) stays stuck awkwardly in the air after it claw catches one of \n\tthe balls. For the final step, your are going to swing that ball over the \n\ttop of the pattern as your non-dominant hand is making its throw (the last \n\tthrow of the previous step). As that ball thrown from your non-dominant hand \n\tdescends, you are going to make another throw from your non-dominant toward \n\tthe center of your body (biased a bit toward the dominant side of your \n\tbody). This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball it \n\tthrew previously. By this point your dominant hand should have finished \n\tits arc around the pattern, where it will end up crossed under your \n\tnon-dominant hand (back where it started). You will then use it to catch the \n\tball just thrown from your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    You have just completed one full cycle of the Icelandic \n\tShuffle. To continue the pattern, simply make an underarm throw from your \n\tdominant hand after it crosses underneath your non-dominant hand. This will \n\tclear space for the hand to catch the final ball from the last cycle and \n\talso \n\tcreate the first throw of the new cycle. The Icelandic Shuffle is a \n\tfast-paced, compact pattern that will take a lot of practice to fully \n\tcontrol. Once mastered however, it becomes a enjoyable pattern to both watch \n\tand juggle. </p>"

      "description": "    Established by well-known juggler Steven \n\tMills, Mills Mess is one of the most famous 3-ball tricks. It involves a \n\tside-to-side movement of the props, with each one thrown over the other in a \n\tnever ending flow. Despite the much higher complexity of the trick, \n\tMills Mess has the same siteswap as a basic Cascade, with the crossing \n\tmotion of your arms \n\tcreating an extra flare that audiences love.<br/><br/>    \n\tTo learn Mills Mess, it helps to break the trick down \n\tinto smaller pieces. Starting with one ball in your dominant hand, cross \n\tthat arm over the other, and throw the ball across your body to your \n\tnon-dominant hand. At the same time, uncross and recross your arms, this \n\ttime with your non-dominant arm on top, and catch the ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess1ball.gif\" width=\"165\"/>    \n\t<br/>    You have just learned the pattern for the first \n\tball of Mills Mess. \n\tPractice until you are very comfortable leading with either hand, since you \n\tmust be able to perform the throw while managing two other balls. <br/>\n<br/>    The second ball starts out in your non-dominant hand, and is \n\tthrown as your arms are uncrossing—specifically the point at which your two \n\tarms are level with each other. The ball is then caught with your dominant \n\thand, now underneath your non-dominant arm.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess1ball2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>    As before, practice this extensively on both sides. You \n\tshould now be ready to combine the first two steps. Start with one ball in \n\teach hand, arms crossed. Throw the first ball as you uncross your arms, and \n\tthen throw the second ball in the same direction once your arms are level. \n\tThen, recross your arms in the opposite configuration and catch the first \n\tball in your non-dominant hand, and the second ball in your dominant hand.<br/>\n<br/> <img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess2ball.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>    Once again, practice this until it is second nature. To \n\tcomplete the Mills Mess pattern, we now have to add the third ball. This is \n\tlikely to be the most difficult step, not because the third ball's path is \n\tdifficult, but because you now have to deal with three balls simultaneously. \n\tThe third ball is thrown last, out of your dominant hand. It is caught by \n\tthe hand that throws the first ball of the next cycle. <br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmesscycle.gif\" style=\"width: 165px; height: 165px\" width=\"400\"/><br/>    \n\tIt is best to start out practicing one cycle at a time, while making sure \n\tthat all of your throws are clean and accurate. Only then should you try \n\tchaining multiple cycles together. Make sure to maintain the flow of the \n\tballs from left to right, since it is easy to decay into messy, vertical \n\tcolumn throws. The Mills Mess pattern itself is not restricted to three \n\tballs, and can in fact be juggled with four, five, and even six balls, in \n\taddition to other prop types like clubs and rings.</p>"

      "description": "     Chops is a fast paced trick in \n\twhich you swing your arms diagonally across your body while holding a prop. \n\tThe trick is most commonly—and impressively—performed with clubs, though \n\tlearning to do the pattern with balls is a necessary prerequisite.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Chops, you need to break the trick down into its two \n\tbasic components: the throw and the carry. Unlike in a normal Cascade (with \n\twhich Chops shares a siteswap), the balls in this pattern are thrown in \n\troughly \n\tvertical columns on each side of your body, instead of across. Therefore, \n\tthe first step to learning Chops is to practice the underarm throw. Start by \n\tjuggling the normal Cascade pattern, and then instead of doing a normal \n\tthrow, reach your hand underneath your other arm and throw the ball straight \n\tup. After moving the hand back, resume juggling a normal Cascade.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopsunder.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    This can be a little tricky at first, but you should get the \n\thang of it fairly quickly. Before moving to the next step, it is important \n\tthat you are able to do underarm throws on each side without stopping.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Notice that whenever you make the underarm throw,  you \n\thave to move your other hand out of the way. For the second part of Chops, \n\tthe carry, you are going to exaggerate that arm motion. Instead of merely \n\tmoving your arm to the side, you need to raise it up and the force it down \n\tacross the center of your body. <img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopsfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/>     \n\tOnce you have the \"chop\" motion itself down, you can chain two of them \n\ttogether, with one chop leading into an underarm throw to set up the next \n\tchop.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopstwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Start by just exaggerating two times in a row, and \n\tmake sure you can make the carry quick and concise. The exact manner in \n\twhich you carry the ball is up to you, as skilled jugglers often perform \n\tchops with slightly different styles. Once you have mastered the carry, you \n\tcan cut down on the amount of non-\"chop\" throws made inbetween, until you reach the \n\tpoint where you can do the pattern fully. This may take sometime, since the \n\tspeed of Chops makes the trick hard to perfect. </p>"

This leads to an awkward Mills Mess pattern \n\tin which the third ball, normally thrown under-the-arm, is instead thrown \n\tover-the-arm, meaning that the throw positions of the first and third ball \n\thave been swapped, hence the name Flipped Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Flipped Mess, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand \n\tover your non-dominant hand (this is the same configuration you would start in \n\tfor the regular Mills Mess), and then make a throw from your dominant hand \n\tback toward the dominant side your body. You will then make a throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand (still crossed underneath your dominant hand) from \n\tthe center of your body toward the dominant side of your body, clearing \n\tspace for the hand to catch the first ball. Finally, you are going to make a \n\tthrow from your dominant hand toward the center of your body, and then catch \n\tthe second ball with your now empty dominant hand.

The \n\thand will then recross <em>over</em> your dominant hand. This position will \n\tset you up to repeat the process on the opposite side of your body, with \n\tyour dominant hand making an under-the-arm throw and catching the ball \n\tthrown from your non-dominant hand.

The slam should be caught by your dominant hand at a height slightly \n\tgreater than the peak of the lower multiplexed ball. After making the slam, \n\tyour non-dominant hand should then claw catch the bottom multiplexed ball \n\t(in a manner similar to what would be done in the Shuffle pattern). After \n\tcatching the slammed ball, your dominant hand will then be pulled between \n\tthe upper and lower multiplexed balls such that it crosses over your \n\tnon-dominant hand. The upper multiplexed ball will then be caught \n\tunder-the-arm by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaithree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. In the next step we \n\twill add in the other vertical throw and the circular arm flourish. Start by \n\tdoing the same throws described in step one and then, as the upper \n\tmultiplexed ball descends toward your non-dominant hand (which should at \n\tthis point still be underneath your dominant hand), make a vertical throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand along the outside of the descending ball, \n\tclearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball. As that \n\tvertical throw is being made, your dominant hand is going to swing around \n\tand pass between the vertical ball just thrown and the caught multiplexed \n\tball. The vertical ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaithree2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. For the final step, we are going \n\tto add the horizontal pass. Start by repeating the previous step and then, \n\tas your dominant hand finishes its flourish, you are going to make a \n\tclose-range pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, which \n\tshould already be holding a ball. This will clear space for your dominant \n\thand to catch the vertical ball thrown previously by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaifull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this single cycle of the pattern on each side. To \n\trun the full Arrow of Asai, simply make another multiplex throw before \n\tcatching the vertical ball. The timing between the multiplex throw and the \n\tvertical ball catch is a grey area, since it is possible to make the \n\tmultiplex shortly <em>after</em> the other ball is caught, although this \n\tbreaks up the pattern and renders it non-continuous. For the greatest \n\teffect, it is probably best that you make the multiplex either before or at \n\tthe same time as the vertical ball is caught. However, when first learning \n\tthe pattern it is best that you not worry about the timing until you have a \n\tgood grasp on the rest of the trick.</p>"

The trick combines lofty crossing throws with a rather \n\tunique pass/drop combination, producing a large and impressive double-arch \n\teffect.

Bring your non-dominant hand to the center of your body, and \n\tthen simultaneously make a high crossing throw from your dominant hand and a \n\tnearly vertical pass from your non-dominant hand to your now empty dominant \n\thand. The pass should be caught at around head height. You will then hold \n\tthe ball in your dominant hand up in the air until the other ball reaches \n\tits peak, making sure to shift your dominant hand over slightly to the \n\tcenter of your body. When the other ball reaches its peak and begins to \n\tdescend you are going to drop the ball in your dominant hand so that it \n\tfollows a similar arc to the other ball (just a lot lower). You will then \n\trapidly bring your dominant hand down and around to catch the ball it just \n\tdropped, while at the same time catching the other ball above it in your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodroptwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Make a high crossing throw from your dominant hand and \n\tthen, as that ball descends, perform the same throws you did in step one, \n\tcatching the high crossing throw you previously made in your now empty \n\tnon-dominant hand. As you carry and then drop the ball in your dominant hand \n\t(as you did in step one) you are going to make an under-the arm vertical \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of your body, \n\tclearing space for that hand to catch the top ball while your dominant hand \n\tcatches the bottom ball (as you also did in step one). The vertical ball \n\twill then be caught by you dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodropthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. There is just one more throw \n\tleft to complete the cycle. Start by performing all of the same throws and \n\tcatches that you did in step two, except before you catch the vertical ball \n\tat the end you are going to make a high under-the-arm throw from your \n\tdominant hand back toward the dominant side of your body, clearing space for \n\tyour dominant hand to catch the vertical ball. Your dominant hand will then \n\talso catch the high ball it just threw.<img height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodropfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As always, practice this on both sides.

Before learning Luke's Shuffle, it \n\twould be wise to already know both the Box and the Shuffle, since parts of \n\tboth tricks are included in this pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The first step to learning Luke's Shuffle is to split the \n\ttrick roughly in half, and practice the slam throw with two balls. Start \n\twith one ball in each hand. Then, throw the ball in your dominant hand \n\tstraight up, while simultaneously passing the ball in your other hand toward \n\tyour now empty dominant hand (as if juggling the normal Box). Once that \n\tsecond ball is caught, bring that hand up over the first ball, and do a slam \n\tthrow out of your dominant hand, claw catching the first ball on your way \n\tdown.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/lukesuffletwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/>\n    Practice this extensively on both sides.

As your dominant \n\thand comes back around, and as the thrown ball descends toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand (which should be at the center of your body ready to catch \n\tthe ball), make simultaneous throws from both your dominant hand, directed \n\ttoward the opposite side of your body, and your non-dominant hand, directed \n\tfrom the center toward your dominant hand. With your dominant hand still up \n\tin the air (make sure to exaggerate the effect), claw catch the ball thrown \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand, while using that hand to catch the ball thrown \n\tfrom your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/manghamsmanglethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

A third ball is then thrown underneath the synchronous balls in a \n\tCascade-like manner. When performed properly, Al's Slide is a fairly \n\tgraceful pattern, with the midair catch flowing naturally from the throwing \n\tmotion preceding it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Al's Slide, start with one ball in each \n\thand. Position your hands so that your dominant hand is at the outside of \n\tyour body, while your non-dominant hand is roughly at the center. \n\tSimultaneously make a throw from each hand such that the balls travel across \n\tyour body toward the opposite side. Now comes the tricky part. As you make \n\tthe throws, continue the motion of your dominant hand such that it follows \n\tthe ball thrown from the center by your non-dominant hand. Once that ball \n\treaches its peak, catch it (but do not claw catch it<em>)</em>, and then \n\tlower your dominant hand and bring it back to the dominant side of your \n\tbody. As your dominant hand is being lowered, you are going to catch the \n\tball originally thrown by your dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidetwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third \n\tball, start with two balls in your non-dominant hand and one ball in your \n\tdominant hand. Make the two simultaneous throws and then use your dominant \n\thand to catch the outside ball at its peak (this is all from step one). As \n\tthe other ball begins to descend toward your non-dominant hand, make a \n\tCascade throw from the center of your body using your non-dominant hand. \n\tThis will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the other ball. By \n\tthis point your dominant hand should be returning to its original position \n\talong the dominant side of your body, where it will catch the third ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just \n\tcompleted one full cycle of Al's Slide. Intuitively, you might be able to \n\teasily figure out how the cycles connect together, in which case you are \n\tfinished with this tutorial. If you can't however, here is one more step to \n\tpractice. Start by juggling the same throws shown above, but instead of \n\tsimply catching the last ball with your dominant hand (which previously had \n\tcaught the outside synchronous ball midair), you are going to make a second \n\tset of synchronous throws, with your dominant hand now in the center and \n\tyour non-dominant hand on the outside (the opposite configuration from when \n\tthey started). Catch the balls with whatever hand feels most comfortable, \n\tsince it is only the throws that are significant in this case.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides as shown in the \n\tanimation. Notice that the second pair of synchronous throws sets you up for \n\ta new cycle of the pattern on the opposite side if your body. To run the \n\tfull Al's Slide, simply perform a midair catch on the outside ball and then \n\tmake another Cascade throw with your other hand. By this point you should \n\tbegin recognizing the pattern and be able to continue it from memory. Al's \n\tSlide is a fairly simple pattern, but will take some practice to make smooth \n\tand graceful. </p>"

While this pattern is the most common version of the 531 Mills \n\tMess, there are in fact two other variations of the trick: one where the \n\thigh throw is made with arms uncrossed, and one with the throw made from the \n\thand crossed over. However, this version, with the high throw made \n\tunder-the-arm, is by far the most popular.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the 531 Mills Mess, start with one ball in each \n\thand. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then \n\tmake a high throw toward the center of your body from your dominant hand. \n\tAfter that ball is thrown, quickly make a low throw toward the center of \n\tyour body from your non-dominant hand, and then uncross your arms.  \n\tCross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand and catch the low ball, \n\tand then catch the high ball with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531millsmesstwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and then cross your \n\tdominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand. Make a high throw and then \n\tuncross and recross your hands such that your dominant hand is now on top. \n\tRight as your hands are uncrossed, make a pass from your dominant hand to \n\tyour non-dominant hand, and then finish crossing your arms.

At this point the high throw should be approaching your \n\tnon-dominant hand, with which you will catch the ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531millsmessthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice these three throws on both sides.

You do not need to already know the Crossunder \n\tpattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Reverse Crossunder, start with one ball \n\tin each hand. Simultaneously make a vertical throw from each hand and then, \n\tas the balls peak and begin to descend, cross your arms and catch each ball \n\twith the hand that didn't throw it.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/reversecrossundertwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this using both arm configurations. To add in the \n\tthird ball, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand. Make a pair of simultaneous vertical throws and then, as \n\tthose balls peak and begin to descend, throw the third ball vertically along \n\tthe center of your body and cross your arms.

To run the full pattern, just make another \n\tpair of vertical throws and remember to cross your arms in the opposite \n\tconfiguration when catching the balls. The Reverse Crossunder is, like the Crossunder, \n\ta fairly easy yet fun variation of Columns that is great for beginners. </p>"

      "description": "     Alex is a difficult three ball \n\tpattern established by William Penman as part of his\n\t<a href=\"http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html\">Hurricane \n\tSeries</a>. It contains an odd mix of synchronous throws, high throws, and \n\twrist-drops. The trick has a very rushed cadence, and this, along with its \n\twide variety of throws, makes Alex quite hard to master. There are no true \n\tprerequisite patterns, but it would probably help to be well versed in \n\tgeneral three ball juggling before attempting this trick.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Alex, start with one ball in each hand. \n\tCross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, but keep both hands \n\tfairly close to the center of your body. Simultaneously, make a roughly \n\tvertical throw from each hand such that the ball from your dominant hand \n\tgoes roughly twice as high as the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand \n\t(measured from the palm of your hand). As the lower ball reaches its peak, \n\tyou are going to grab it out of the air with your dominant hand and then \n\trecross your arms such that the palm of your dominant hand is pointing \n\ttoward the ground. You will catch the second ball under-the-arm with your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alextwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. For the next step, you are going \n\tto add in the wrist-drop. A wrist-drop occurs when, in a crossed-arm \n\tposition, the top hand releases its ball and then quickly uncrosses and \n\trecrosses underneath the other hand, catching the ball that it had just \n\treleased. In Alex the wrist-drop occurs after the first catch of the \n\tprevious step, when your dominant hand grabs the lower ball. After that \n\tcatch is made, you are going to release the ball in your dominant hand with \n\ta small amount of upward movement, giving you enough time to recross your \n\tdominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, catching the released ball \n\tpalm-up as your hand moves into position. The other ball should be caught by \n\tyour non-dominant just as you begin to uncross your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alextwo2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third \n\tball, you are going to start with two balls in your dominant hand and one \n\tball in your non-dominant. Make a high vertical throw from your dominant \n\thand along the outside of your body, then cross your dominant hand over your \n\tnon-dominant hand and make the simultaneous throws from the previous two \n\tsteps, catching the outside vertical ball with your now empty non-dominant \n\thand (which at this point is crossed underneath your dominant hand). Grab \n\tthe lower ball out of the air with your dominant hand and execute the \n\twrist-drop from step two. As you do this, you are also going to make a high \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand along the outside of the upper ball, which \n\tshould now be descending toward your non-dominant hand where it will then be \n\tcaught. The high ball will then be caught by your dominant hand, which \n\tshould now be crossed underneath your non-dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alexthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively on both sides. To run the full \n\tpattern, simply make another set of simultaneous throws underneath the last \n\thigh ball, setting up a new cycle on the opposite side of your body. Alex is \n\tnot an easy trick, and will most likely take a week or two of practice to \n\tget solid. </p>"

Start by \n\tdoing a single overthrow, and then do a second overthrow from that same \n\thand. After you do that, fall back into the regular Cascade. The idea is to \n\tslowly add in more overthrows as you are practicing.

Before attempting the Broken Shower, it would be wise to learn the \n\tShower Cascade, since that pattern prepare you for the underarm catch. <br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Broken Shower, start with one ball in each hand. \n\tBring your dominant hand to the center of your body, and then raise it up \n\tabout six inches. Make a fairly high throw from your dominant hand toward \n\tthe dominant side of your body (the opposite direction of a normal Shower), \n\twhile simultaneously making a pass from your non-dominant hand (which should \n\tbe raised higher than your dominant hand). After your non-dominant hand \n\tmakes the pass, continue the motion so that your non-dominant hand crosses \n\tunderneath your dominant hand. Use it to catch the high throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenshowertwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can do the throw/pass combination \n\tconsistently.

Cross \n\tyour arms such that your dominant hand is over your non-dominant hand, and \n\tthen make a vertical under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand. As \n\tthat ball reaches it peak, make a vertical throw from your dominant hand and \n\tthen uncross your arms, claw catching the first ball with your dominant hand \n\twhile catching the second ball with your non-dominant hand (the balls have \n\teach been caught by the hand that did not throw them).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakentwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

Claw \n\tcatch the first ball with your non-dominant hand, and then make a second \n\tvertical throw from your dominant hand (your non-dominant hand should be \n\tabove it). This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the second \n\tball (the vertical throw made from your non-dominant hand before it \n\tuncrossed). The third ball will then be caught from above with your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

The throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand should be very light, and in fact more closely \n\tresembles a simple drop. After your non-dominant hand claw catches its ball, \n\tyou are going to cross it underneath your dominant hand, which itself is \n\tgoing to cross over and catch the ball dropped from your non-dominant hand. \n\tThus your hands will end up crossed in the opposite configuration from when \n\tthey started (note that the animation below cheats, since it doesn't uncross \n\tand recross its hands when it begins a new cycle).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

At this point we have \n\tcompleted one full cycle of the Kraken. From here, you might intuitively be \n\table to figure out how the cycles connect, at which point you will be able \n\tto juggle the full pattern. If however you are not quite able to see the \n\tcontinuation, there is one more step to practice. Start by juggling one full \n\tcycle (i.e. juggle the previous step) and then, instead of simply catching \n\tthe last ball with your non-dominant hand, you are going to make a vertical \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand along the outside of that ball, clearing \n\tspace for your non-dominant hand to catch it. At this point your dominant \n\thand should be crossed over your non-dominant hand.

      "description": "     Jeanne is a three ball trick \n\testablished by William Penman as part of his\n\t<a href=\"http://unknownjuggling.tripod.com/hurricaneseries.html\">Hurricane \n\tSeries</a>. It is essentially a hybrid of Orka's Mess and Rubenstein's \n\tRevenge, with the flourish of the latter pattern being tacked on to the \n\tending flourish of Orka's Mess. The harmonious combination of the two arm \n\tmovements gives Jeanne a very smooth and complex flow. Before trying this \n\tpattern, it is important that you already be able to juggle Orka's Mess and \n\tRubenstein's Revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Jeanne, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Raise your dominant hand up \n\tand then cross your non-dominant hand underneath it such that the balls are \n\tlined up along a single vertical axis. Simultaneously make a throw from each \n\thand toward the opposite (non-dominant) side of your body, and then follow \n\tthat up with a throw from your dominant also directed toward the opposite \n\tside of your body. This throw will clear space for your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the top ball from the simultaneous pair (the same ball that it threw) \n\twhile your non-dominant hand catches the bottom ball. At this point your \n\tdominant hand should be crossed over your non-dominant hand, as your \n\tnon-dominant hand then makes a vertical throw along the dominant side of \n\tyour body. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the \n\tsecond ball thrown from your dominant hand. While this is happening, your \n\tdominant hand will spin around between the ball thrown and ball being caught \n\twith your non-dominant hand, crossing underneath your non-dominant hand. So \n\tfar, this has all been identical to Orka's Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n    However, as your dominant hand rotates into position, you \n\twill begin to swing your non-dominant hand around along roughly the same \n\tpath, making an under-the-arm throw from your dominant hand toward the \n\tcenter of your body as your dominant hand finishes its rotation (your \n\tnon-dominant hand should be about halfway through its own swing by this \n\ttime). This throw will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the \n\tvertical ball thrown from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of \n\tyour body. Your non-dominant hand will then finish its rotation, ending up \n\tstill crossed over your dominant hand and positioned near the non-dominant \n\tside of your body, catching the last ball thrown from your dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/jeannefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. In this step you are \n\tessentially grafting part of Rubenstein's Revenge on to the end of Orka's \n\tMess, so while the written instructions above may seem long, the actual \n\tthrows themselves should feel very natural (until the last throw or two) if \n\tyou already know Orka's Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To juggle the full Jeanne pattern, simply make another set of \n\tsimultaneous throws using both hands before catching the last ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand. This will begin a new cycle of the trick, with the hand \n\tpositions reversed. Jeanne is a very graceful pattern that is both enjoyable \n\tto juggle and watch. Assuming you already have the prerequisite patterns \n\tmastered, this trick should not be very hard to learn.</p>"

This trick looks decent—though the other \n\ttower patterns look better—but is a pain to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tTaking a close look at the trick, we can see that there are three throws: a \n\thigh throw (5), a low throw (3), and a horizontal pass (1). We can also see \n\tthat the highest throw and the pass alternate balls, while a single ball is \n\tused for the lower throw.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"130\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531colored.gif\" width=\"130\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tIt is best to begin learning the 531 by practicing the high throw and the \n\tpass. Start with two balls in your dominant hand. Throw one ball high across \n\tyour body, and immediately make a horizontal pass to your other hand. Then, \n\tusing that ball you just passed, you are going to make another high throw \n\tacross your body, and then catch the first ball you threw. Then, pass that \n\tball and repeat the cycle:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531firststep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tPractice this pattern until you have it solid. These two throws are \n\tidentical to the ones made in the 531, and the third ball fits into the \n\tspace between them. For the next step, you are going to practice making that \n\tlower throw. Start with one ball in each hand. Make one high throw, and then \n\tmake a lower throw (less than a normal cascade throw) with the other ball. \n\tYou want to time these throws so that the second ball (low height) lands in \n\tyour hand slightly before the high throw:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531secondstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tThis is an important step. The timing of these two throws must be \n\tconsistent, or your entire pattern will fall apart. Once you have the \n\tprevious steps mastered, you are ready to put everything together. Start \n\twith three balls—two in your dominant hand, one in your non-dominant. Throw \n\tone ball high across your body, then a low throw from the other hand, then \n\timmediately do a pass from your dominant hand. Using that ball you just \n\tpassed, make another high throw (going the other way), and repeat the cycle:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531thirdstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tYou have just done a full run of the 531. It is very important that you \n\tpractice both sides evenly, as running the trick for any length of time will \n\trequire many throws from both sides. The 531 is not an easy or pleasant \n\ttrick to master. The timing will feel rushed and awkward at first, and the \n\ttrick itself is only somewhat pleasing to the eye.</p>"

The trick consists of an upward diagonal pass \n\tfollowed by a traditional Factory carry, with most of the added complexity \n\tcoming from the pass. For obvious reasons, you should already be comfortable \n\twith the standard Factories before attempting this pattern, and it helps to know the \n\tN-Box as well (though this isn't necessary).<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Zebra Factory, start with one ball in \n\teach hand. Make an upward diagonal throw from your non-dominant hand toward \n\tyour dominant side, while simultaneously throwing the ball in your dominant \n\thand underneath the diagonal ball in an arc toward your non-dominant hand. \n\tYou will then raise your now empty dominant hand and catch the diagonal ball \n\tat about shoulder height. As the other ball begins to descend toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand, you will horizontally shift your dominant hand to the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body (as if doing the Factory). Lastly, you will \n\tcatch the second ball with your non-dominant hand. The ball carried in your \n\tdominant hand is not thrown.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/zebrafactorytwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this step until you are very comfortable making the \n\ttwo throws.

Make a diagonal pass \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand and an arcing throw from your dominant hand (as \n\tyou did in step one) and then, as the arcing ball descends toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand and as your dominant hand is finishing its carry, you are \n\tgoing to throw the second ball in your non-dominant hand toward the dominant \n\tside of your body. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch \n\tthe arcing ball thrown at the beginning. As the ball just thrown by your \n\tnon-dominant hand reaches its peak, you are going to drop the ball in your \n\tdominant hand and quickly snatch the other ball at its peak (just as you \n\twould in the Factory). As the dropped ball is descending toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand, you will make a roughly vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand near the center of your body, clearing space for your hand \n\tto catch the dropped ball. You will then catch this vertical throw with your \n\tnon-dominant hand as well.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/zebrafactorythree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this step until you are comfortable with \n\tall of the throws. To continue the pattern, simply make another \n\tdiagonal/arcing throw pair before catching the vertical ball, and proceed \n\tfrom there. The Zebra Factory is a good trick for the intermediate juggler \n\twho wants to add an interesting twist to the basic Factory, and is not \n\tespecially difficult. </p>"

That last \n\tball is thrown higher than the rest to accommodate the added arm movements, \n\tresulting in a 52233 siteswap.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Rubenstein's Revenge, it is best to begin by \n\tisolating the flourish. Start with two balls, one in each hand, with your \n\tnon-dominant arm crossed over your dominant. Then, uncross your arms, \n\ttracing a circle with the two balls, and then begin to re-cross your arms, \n\tthrowing the ball from your non-dominant hand (now on the bottom) back \n\tacross your body as if in a Mills Mess. Keep circling around with your \n\tdominant arm, and throw the ball in that hand behind the first ball, again \n\tas if in a Mills Mess.

Throw a ball from your dominant hand vertically, and then \n\texecute the flourish. After making the first throw of the flourish, you are \n\tgoing to catch the ball you threw vertically using that hand.

With this in mind, it would be wise for you \n\tto already be comfortable with Rubenstein's Revenge and Romeo's Revenge \n\tbefore attempting this pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n   To begin learning Relf's Rubensteins, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross your dominant \n\thand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a vertical \n\tunder-the-arm throw from dominant hand. As you do this you are also going to \n\tbegin uncrossing and then recrossing your arms The first ball should be \n\tdescending just as you complete the recrossing, so you will then make an \n\tunder-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant \n\tside of your body, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the \n\tfirst ball. You will then swing your dominant hand (which should at this \n\tpoint be crossed over your non-dominant hand) under, around, and then above \n\tthe thrown ball. So far this has all been identical to Rubenstein's Revenge. \n\tHowever, instead of claw catching the ball in the air you are going to \n\tfollow it with your dominant hand as the ball descends. You will then make a \n\tsecond under-the-arm throw—vertical this time—from your non-dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for the hand to catch the first ball it threw (the ball your \n\tdominant hand is following).

You will then continue the downward motion of the \n\tclaw catch and recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand. As \n\tthe ball thrown by your dominant hand begins to descend you will make \n\tanother vertical under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand, clearing \n\tspace for it to catch the descending ball.

Ironically this \"mathematically impossible\" \n\ttrick is actually a fairly easy three ball pattern, as long as you are \n\talready comfortable with Chops and the Boston Shuffle.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Tom's Trick, start with two balls in your \n\tnon-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Raise your dominant arm up \n\tand shift your non-dominant hand to the center of your body. Perform a chop \n\twith your dominant hand while simultaneously making a fairly vertical \n\tunder-the-arm throw along the dominant side of your body with your \n\tnon-dominant hand. As that ball reaches its peak and begins to descend your \n\tdominant hand should be finishing its chop. Once that arm motion is finished \n\tyou are going to make a throw from your dominant hand toward the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body, clearing space for your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the under-the-arm throw. Your non-dominant hand will then perform a \n\tslam throw to your dominant hand, claw catching the ball your dominant hand \n\tjust threw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/tomstrickthree.gif\" width=\"404\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step you \n\tare going to make a throw from your dominant hand toward the non-dominant \n\tside of your body before catching the slammed ball (instead of simply \n\tcatching and holding both balls as done in the previous step). As that ball \n\tcrosses through the center of your body, make a normal Cascade-style throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand toward your dominant hand. After that throw you \n\tare going to raise your non-dominant hand up and grab out of the air the \n\tball that had been thrown by your dominant hand. You will then perform a \n\tchop with your non-dominant hand while simultaneously making an \n\tunder-the-arm throw with your dominant hand, clearing space for that hand to \n\tcatch the Cascade throw previously made by your non-dominant hand. The \n\tunder-the-arm throw will be caught by your non-dominant hand after the chop \n\tis completed.<img alt=\"\" height=\"486\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/tomstrickfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. Notice how the final \n\tunder-the-arm throw and chop are a mirror image of how you started. To \n\tcontinue the pattern simply repeat the step using the opposite hand \n\tconfiguration. Overall Tom's Trick is a relatively easy pattern to master \n\twhile being surprisingly enjoyable to juggle.</p>"

      "description": "\n   \nThe Chop Shower is a Windmill variation that incorporates a fast chopping arm motion, in an opposing direction to the ball flight paths.\nOnce the Windmill pattern has been mastered, an obvious and popular mutation is to switch which arm crosses over the other when reaching\nacross your body to catch. While more difficult than the standard Windmill, this variation can often appear awkward and usually has less visual\nappeal. By simply supplementing this variation an additional chop element, the Chop Shower establishes a more mechanically\nstable and balanced pattern while also improving the overall appearance.<br/><br/>\n\n   \nTo learn the Chop Shower, start with the base Windmill pattern. Notice that each arm plays a different role; one arm can be described as the\ntop arm and the other serves as the bottom arm. While maintaining the same ball paths, switch the arm roles. As noted above, this will likely\nfeel quite awkward. The next step is to note where the top arm is catching the ball, and raise that point so that your forearm is vertically\noriented when the catch is made. This higher catch reduces the in-flight time, allowing time for a chop to be made prior to the next throw\nby that hand. For the chop, try to keep your elbow close to your body and as stationary as possible, so that your forearm rotates like the\nhand of a clock. Drill a single strong and rapid chop until you have locked this movement into muscle memory.\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopshower_start.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n\n   \nAfter you are comfortable with chopping as depicted above, attempt to mix a chop into the Windmill, swiping the chopped ball between the other\ntwo. Then progress to chopping the same ball every time, then every other catch, then two consecutive chops. After completing each of these steps,\nyou soon should be able to run the pattern without much further difficulty.\n<br/><br/>\n\n   \nFor optimal clarity, try not to carry the chopped ball in front of or behind a thrown ball. If you are having trouble carrying the chopped ball\nbetween the other two balls, you can experiment with either chopping over both of the other two balls, or underneath them, as shown below. Depending\nupon the length of your arms and chopping speed, one of these variations may seem more natural. Both of them maintain the fundamental identity of\nthe pattern and are worth the investment to attempt.\n<table align=\"center\"><tr>\n<td>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopshower_over.gif\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n<td>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopshower_under.gif\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n\n   \nAs a standalone and simple repeating pattern, the Chop Shower has legitimate merit. However, it is perhaps better-utilized as a mechanical concept\nto enhance other patterns containing crossed-arm movements. The quarter-circle carry of the chopped ball supplies a nice contrast to the\nparabolic thrown ball arches. For example, it can easily be mixed with the Shower, Mills Mess, and/or the Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade to construct\ninteresting new patterns. Plenty of symmetric pattern possibilities should be apparent after learning it in both directions.\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Tutorial created and submitted by Andrew Olson. </strong>\n</p>"

Raise your \n\tnon-dominant hand up to about shoulder height, and then bring both hands to \n\tthe center of your body such that your dominant hand is positioned under \n\tyour non-dominant hand. Then make an under-the-arm throw from your dominant \n\thand back toward the dominant side of your body while simultaneously \n\tswinging your non-dominant hand in a circle around and then under the thrown ball. \n\tAs that ball peaks and begins to descend you will follow it from above with \n\tyour non-dominant hand, which should have finished circling around. Your \n\tdominant hand will then make a second under-the-arm throw from the same \n\tposition as the first, though the throw itself should be more \n\tvertical. This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the first \n\tball, after which you will catch the second ball with your non-dominant \n\thand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"448\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevengethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Your non-dominant hand, having been following the first ball, \n\twill slide down along the inside of your dominant hand, which will in turn \n\tbegin to shift up and around such that it ends up close to the center of your body \n\tat about shoulder height. At this point the second ball (the last throw you \n\tmade in first step) will be descending, so you will make an under-the-arm \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant side of your \n\tbody before catching the second ball with your non-dominant hand. As this \n\tthird throw is being made your dominant hand will swing around and then \n\tunder the thrown ball.

To continue the pattern simply \n\tmake a second under-the-arm throw with your non-dominant hand and then use \n\tit catch the ball being followed by your dominant hand. This will set you up \n\tto repeat the circular arm flourish with your non-dominant hand, at which \n\tpoint you are right back where you started. Relf's Revenge is not an \n\tespecially hard pattern, but its rarity will make the trick more impressive \n\tto other jugglers. </p>"

The ball just thrown will \n\tthen be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/mikesmessthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides until you can perform the motions \n\tsmoothly and throw accurately. To perform the full pattern, simply repeat \n\tthe arm motions after every throw, making sure that you are both catching \n\tand throwing under-the-arm. Mike's Mess is a pretty easy pattern, and can be \n\thelpful when learning Mills Mess.   </p>"

This Fork quickly separates the multiplexed \n\tballs, allowing for extra throws/catches to be made while also creating a \n\tvery unique aesthetic. The actual throws made in the Forklift are fairly \n\tsimple, but controlling the Fork \"throw\" takes a fair amount of practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Forklift, it is best to begin by practicing the \n\tFork. Start with two balls in your non-dominant hand, and then make a fairly \n\tvertical throw at the center of your body. As this ball reaches its peak, \n\tyou are going to make a second vertical throw underneath it from your \n\tnon-dominant hand while simultaneously pushing the first ball upwards using \n\tthe first two fingers of your dominant hand (your palm should be facing \n\tdownward). If done correctly, the first ball should stay in the same \n\tvertical column as the second ball, and the distance between the two balls \n\tshould remain roughly the same. After the Fork, you are going to bring your \n\tdominant hand down and claw catch the second ball, allowing the first ball \n\tto fall into your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/forklifttwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides, making sure that the Fork is \n\tdone in a controlled manner. To add in the third ball, start with two balls \n\tin your dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a normal \n\tCascade throw from your non-dominant hand, and then do a split multiplex \n\tfrom your dominant hand, clearing space for that hand to catch the first \n\tthrow. After that ball is caught, you are going to bring your dominant hand \n\tunderneath the multiplexed ball that is farthest away from your dominant \n\tside. Simultaneously, you are going to bring your non-dominant hand directly \n\tunderneath the multiplexed ball closest to it (the same ball that your \n\tdominant hand is now under). Once your hands are in these positions, you are \n\tgoing to make a vertical throw from your dominant hand, immediately followed \n\tby a vertical Fork \"throw\". These two throws are identical to the ones \n\tpracticed in step one. Your dominant hand will now be free to catch the \n\tother multiplexed ball, while your non-dominant hand will claw catch the \n\tvertical ball just thrown from your dominant hand. The Forked ball will then \n\tbe caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/forkliftthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n     Again, practice this on both sides. To finish the \n\tcycle, you are going to make a second vertical throw along the outside of \n\tyour body from your dominant hand to clear space for the Forked ball to be \n\tcaught. You will then take your non-dominant hand, which has just claw \n\tcaught a ball, and swing it up and around to the outside of your body, claw \n\tcatching the ball just thrown from your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/forkliftfull.gif\" width=\"392\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. You may have noticed \n\tthat this step finishes with a ball configuration that is opposite of the \n\tone you started with. To run another cycle and continue the full Forklift \n\tpattern, you simply need to make another Cascade throw (with the other hand \n\tthis time) after you swing your arm around to catch the final ball. The \n\tForklift is an intermediate pattern, and as such it may take a couple of \n\tdays to fully master. Remember, to achieve the best aesthetic, you will want \n\tto make your Fork \"throw\" as vertical as possible.</p>"

The \n\tdifficulty of the pass, combined with cramped vertical throws, makes the \n\tBroken Box a fairly hard variation to master.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Broken Box, start with one ball in each hand. \n\tMake a vertical throw from your dominant hand coupled with a horizontal pass \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand, just like in the regular Box. However, as you \n\tare throwing the horizontal pass, continue the motion of your arm so that it \n\tcrossed underneath your dominant hand. At this moment, the vertical ball \n\tshould be at its peak, and your non-dominant hand should be crossed \n\tunderneath your dominant hand. As the vertical ball begins to descend back \n\ttoward your dominant hand, make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand \n\twhile simultaneously uncrossing your non-dominant hand to receive the ball. \n\tThis pass should clear space for your dominant hand to catch the vertical \n\tball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenboxtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can make the vertical throw and \n\thorizontal passes consistently.

Start with two balls, one in each hand, and arms crossed. Uncross \n\tand recross your arms, then throw a ball vertically from your bottom hand \n\t(which started out on top).

      "description": "\n     Levels is a multi-level shape distortion of the Extended Box (a.k.a Double Box) that incorporates\nseveral different types of throws into a symmetric and visually appealing pattern. It is a moderately difficult pattern,\nbut when properly executed, its difficulty is well-hidden by the apparent simplicity. Because its shape is quite simple,\nthis is a fantastic base pattern from which many interesting variations can be found, similar to the Box itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n     To learn the Levels pattern, you can start by introducing a Luke's Shuffle-style slam throw into the\nstandard Box pattern. Keep this throw as horizontal as possible, such that it is caught at a higher\nelevation than normal, and the concurrent Box throw from the opposite hand is thrown to an even greater height. Next,\nrelease the shuffled-over ball so that it falls downward and then very quickly move that same hand upward to catch the ball it just\nthrew. This catch should occur at the top of the pattern, while the other hand tosses a low throw in the center of\nyour body, or even slightly on the other side of your body as an underarm throw. Finally, slam the ball which was caught\nat the top of the pattern down and subsequently claw the center ball, as in the N-Box, and proceed juggling\nthe Box.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/levels_start.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n     Practice this 3-beat sequence on both sides. Once you are comfortable with these throws, the final step\nis to simply change the last N-Box throw into the initial Luke's Shuffle throw for the flipped cycle, then continue repeating\nthe pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n     One key aspect to understanding this pattern is that the vertical throw on each side must be caught\nwhen the ball has reached its peak. Your hand therefore needs to chase up after the ball immediately\nafter throwing it, stopping midway to perform a very quick catch and release of the ball being thrown down\ndiagonally from the top of the other side of the pattern. The angle of this diagonal throw is somewhere in\nbetween an N-Box slam and a horizontal Inverted Box throw, since it is caught at the middle level\nof the pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Tutorial created and submitted by Andrew Olson. </strong>\n</p>"

This \n\tpattern lacks the more intuitive flow of Mills Mess, and doesn't look as \n\tcool to spectators.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Boston Mess, it is best to start by juggling The \n\tW. After catching an inside throw with your dominant hand (the outside ball \n\ton your dominant hand side should be in the air), make an outside throw with \n\tyour non-dominant hand and then cross that hand under your dominant hand, \n\tcatching the outside ball usually caught by your dominant hand. Then throw \n\tthe center ball currently in your dominant hand, clearing space to allow \n\tthat hand to catch the outside ball normally caught by your non-dominant \n\thand (essentially your hands have switched which balls they are throwing \n\twithout changing the overall shape of the pattern).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonmesstwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until it is second nature, since the next step \n\tis simply going to add more throws to the sequence. After the last throw of \n\tprevious step, you should end up with your arms crossed and the center ball \n\tin the air. As that ball comes down, you are going to make an outside throw \n\twith your non-dominant hand (which should be crossed under your dominant \n\thand) and catch the center ball. Then, as that outside throw is coming down, \n\tyou are going to make an outside throw with your dominant hand, and then \n\tuncross your arms, catching the non-dominant hand's outside throw. Finally, \n\tas that last outside throw is coming down, you are going to make a center \n\tthrow with your non-dominant hand and catch the outside ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonmessnext.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/>\n    Again, practice this step until it is second nature. At this \n\tpoint, the Boston Mess pretty much starts over back at step one, with your \n\tdominant hand making an outside throw and catching the center ball, and your \n\tnon-dominant hand reaching over to grab the outside ball normally caught by \n\tyour dominant hand. However, as you may have noticed, the full Boston Mess \n\talternates the top hand, such that after you complete one cycle with your \n\tdominant hand crossed over your non-dominant hand, the next cycle will have \n\tyour non-dominant hand crossed over your dominant hand. This doesn't \n\tactually change the order of the throws, it just alters the relative \n\tposition of your hands. The Boston Mess is a pretty difficult pattern to \n\tfigure out, so if you are still unable to perform the pattern, try following \n\tone of the other tutorials listed at the top right corner of this page.  </p>"

Simultaneously, make \n\ta horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. The \n\tpass should be timed such that it goes under the vertical ball. As your \n\tnon-dominant hand catches the pass, you are going to pull it back to the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body, at a distance away from the center that \n\tmatches the distance from the center that your dominant hand was before the \n\tpass. Your dominant hand should then be crossed over to the non-dominant \n\tside of your body (essentially your hands are mirroring the position they \n\twere in at the start). As the vertical ball first thrown begins to descend, \n\tmake a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand while simultaneously \n\tbringing your dominant hand up to receive it near the center of your body. \n\tYour non-dominant hand will then cross underneath your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the vertical ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threadedboxtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third \n\tball, you are going to start with two balls in your dominant hand and one \n\tball in your non-dominant. Bring your dominant hand over to your \n\tnon-dominant side and make a vertical throw. Then, bring your dominant hand \n\tback over to your dominant side while also bringing your non-dominant hand \n\tto your dominant side (your hands should now be in the same position as they \n\twould be at the beginning of step one). As the first ball begins to descend, \n\tmake a second vertical throw, from your non-dominant hand this time, and \n\tthen make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant \n\thand (just like you did in step one). Right after you make the pass, cross \n\tyour dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand and catch the first \n\tball. As you non-dominant hand catches the pass, bring the hand to the \n\toutside of your body. Catch the second ball with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threadedboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides as shown in the \n\tanimation above.  To run the full Threaded Box, simply make another \n\tvertical throw/horizontal pass combination as the second vertical ball \n\tbegins to descend. This will mark the beginning of a second cycle, after \n\twhich you will simply keep repeating cycles on alternating sides. </p>"

This fusion of parts from \n\ttwo very different tricks results in a pattern with a highly distinct timing \n\tand feel. Before attempting the Georgian Scuffle, you should already be very \n\tfamiliar with the Georgian Shuffle. Experience with the Kraken will also \n\tmake the pattern much easier to learn, though this is not required.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Georgian Scuffle, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a fake throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand back to itself (as would be done in the Georgian Shuffle) \n\tand then, as you catch the ball, make a split multiplex from your dominant \n\thand. As the balls reach their peak, claw catch the ball furthest from your \n\tdominant hand with that hand. As you claw catch the \n\tmultiplexed ball, you are going to make an under-the-arm vertical throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of your body, clearing \n\tspace for your non-dominant hand to catch the other multiplexed ball (the \n\tone that was closest to your dominant hand). So far these throws and catches \n\thave been identical to those in the Georgian Shuffle. <br/>\n<br/>\n    As that vertical ball reaches \n\tits peak, you are going to basically drop the ball in your dominant hand \n\t(you will still give the ball a bit of upward motion as you release it) and \n\tthen use that same hand to claw catch the vertical ball. As the ball dropped \n\tfrom your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you are going to \n\tmake a throw along the center of your body using your non-dominant hand, \n\twhich will then catch the ball dropped from your dominant hand. The center \n\tball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianscufflethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can perform and catch all the throws \n\tconsistently, especially the midair drop. For the next step you are going to \n\tadd in a second midair drop from your dominant hand, using the ball that was \n\tcaught after the first midair drop (the ball that was grabbed from the air \n\tawkwardly at the end of the previous animation). After performing the drop, \n\tyou are going to claw catch the center ball thrown from your non-dominant \n\thand out of the air. Simultaneously, you are going to bring your \n\tnon-dominant hand, which should have recently caught a ball, over to the \n\tdominant side of your body, where it will make a vertical throw along the \n\toutside of the ball your dominant hand dropped. This will clear space for \n\tyour non-dominant hand to catch that dropped ball. You will then take your \n\tdominant hand, which just caught the center ball, and circle it over and \n\taround the vertical ball just thrown from your non-dominant hand, catching \n\tit as you finish.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianscufflefinal.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    To run the full pattern, simply make another fake throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand as your dominant hand is catching the final ball. \n\tThis will set you up for the next cycle.

Cross your non-dominant \n\thand over to the dominant side of your body, and then position your dominant \n\thand above your non-dominant hand such that your arm is bent upward.

As your dominant hand is completing its motion, the \n\tthrown ball will be approaching your non-dominant hand, which should have \n\tshifted back over to the non-dominant side of your body.

      "description": "     The Half-Box is one of the first tricks jugglers learn \n\tthat includes a horizontal pass (the ball that goes directly between hands). \n\tThe pattern is almost universally known by its siteswap, and thus is usually \n\tjust called the 441. There have been attempts at giving it a name (some have \n\ttried to call it Parallel Schizophrenic), but none of them have stuck. I \n\tthink the name Half-Box matches the trick quite nicely, as it is similar to \n\tthe normal Box, except slower and easier. This is not unlike the Half-Shower \n\tand regular Shower patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tRegardless of the name, learning the Half-Box is fairly simple. Breaking the \n\tpattern down, we can see that there are three main components: a Two-in-One \n\tin the left hand, then a pass, then a Two-in-One in the right hand. Thus, \n\tyou should already be proficient at the Two-in-One in both hands, and also \n\tbe able to do a solid Cascade before attempting this trick.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tTo begin practicing, you are going to start with two balls—one in your left \n\tand one in your right. Then, you are going to make one throw straight up (as \n\tif doing a Two-in-One) from your dominant hand, and then right after that \n\tyou are going to make a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your \n\tnow empty dominant hand. Then, you are going to make a second Two-in-One \n\tthrow with that ball you just passed, and then catch the first ball. And \n\tfinally, you are going to pass that first ball to your non-dominant and \n\tcatch the second ball. The balls should end up in a different hand than when \n\tthey started:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441firststep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tYou are going to want to practice this in each hand, as it is the foundation \n\tof the Half-Box. Once you can reliably perform these throws in both \n\tdirections, you are ready to link them together:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441secondstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tNow its just a matter of adding the third ball. Start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand, one ball in the other. Throw one ball from your dominant \n\thand, then throw the ball in your non-dominant hand. Right after you throw \n\tthat second ball, do a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your \n\tnon-dominant hand, and then stop. You have just done one run of the \n\tHalf-Box:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441flash.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tAll that's left is just to remove the pause and keep the pattern going. This \n\tcan be done by throwing another Two-in-One throw at the end of the flash, \n\tand just repeating the cycle again:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441thirdstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tAnd there you have it. Just keep adding in more and more cycles and \n\teventually you will be able to the Half-Box indefinitely. As the name \n\tsuggests, this trick is perfect for practicing the Box (though I personally \n\tlearned the Box first)but it can also be good training for the Shower \n\tpattern. </p>"

This pattern is a variation of \"real tennis \" ( 423 with the 3s thrown over the top of the pattern). In Burke's barrage, the 4s (non-crossing throws) are thrown under the arm , and the 3s (crossing throws) are caught under the arm. The 4s should be caught using claw catches. Another way to describe the pattern is as a 423  Mills mess where the 4s are thrown under the arm. Variations Edit      Takeouts or Charlie's cheat is a variation where after a 4 is caught, that ball is carried over the top of the pattern. This is how Burke's barrage was described in the first edition of Charlie Dancey's  Encyclopædia of Ball Juggling . (The way Ken Burke originally did it, that ball is carried through the middle of the pattern, going under the 4 that was thrown next.)    Luke Burrage invented a 5 ball multiplex trick called \" Burke's Burrage \" that combines the original Burke's barrage with the \"takeouts\" variation.    Reverse Burke's barrage      \"Box barrage\" ( Luke's shuffle with switched columns ) is a box variation that is just like Burke's barrage, except it's a synchronous pattern.

Squeezes can be much more difficult than multiplex throws, because the objects have to be thrown just right so that they land very close together. A squeeze catch can occur in a siteswap when a throw of value N is followed M beats later by a throw of value (N - M), with both throws directed to the same hand - for example, a 4 and a 4x thrown from different hands at the same time, or a 3 thrown right after a 4, or a 7 with a 5 two beats after it. In vanilla siteswap, patterns with collisions like this are invalid, but it's possible to write valid patterns with squeezes using multiplex notation, by writing the next throw made by the hand that did the squeeze catch as a multiplex throw involving the same number of objects that were just caught by that hand. (This \"multiplex throw\" can include a 2, which would usually mean that one of the objects stays in that hand while others are thrown, so it may not be an actual multiplex throw.) The time-reverse of 5 ball splits - ([44x],2)* - is the squeeze pattern ([42],4x)*, where the 4 from one hand and the 4x from the other hand land at the same time in the hand that threw the 4. Siteswaps like this can also be done without using actual squeeze catches, by throwing the objects to slightly different heights so that they don't land at the same time. Clustered patterns like [33], [44], and [55] are normally done with the stacked throws staggered so that the objects are caught one at a time.

One-handed juggling is normally done in a \" rolling out \" pattern, so the objects go in an arc to the right (clockwise) if the right hand is being used, and to the left (counter-clockwise) if the left hand is being used. Other one-handed patterns include \" rolling in \" (where the objects go in an arc in the opposite direction), columns , and patterns with the same shape as two-handed patterns, such as a one-handed 3 ball  cascade . One-handed juggling is the foundation of the most common method for juggling an even number of objects in two hands: the fountain pattern, where two one-handed patterns are done at the same time, with each hand juggling the same number of objects. A pseudohalfshower is also two one-handed patterns done at the same time, but with a different number of objects in each hand. A basic one-handed pattern is written in siteswap notation as an even number (twice the number of objects used) followed by a 0. Vanilla siteswaps can be interpreted as one-handed patterns. Each number represents the kind of throw you would do if you were juggling that number of objects in one hand. A 0 is a beat with an empty hand, and a 1 is a pause with an object held in the hand. You can write a one-handed interpretation of a siteswap in two-handed notation by replacing each number with the siteswap for juggling that number of objects in one hand. The one-handed version of 423 written in two-handed siteswap is 804060 . Siteswaps can also be done in shower and diabolo patterns in a similar way.

This is a common pattern for passing 6 objects, with two people doing cascades and passing on every other right-hand throw. With 8 objects it can be done either entirely in the wimpy pattern , alternating between throwing a right hand pass and a left hand crossing throw, and then two crossing throws, or the two throws between passes can be non-crossing, so the pattern alternates between two throws of a wimpy pattern with one hand throwing to the other person, and two throws of a synch fountain . The second method is the one that would be used for rings and clubs since those props are not good for wimpy patterns. A 4-count for an odd number of objects is the same as a 4-count for the even number just below that number (including the way the hands are synchronized) except the passes are higher than the other throws (e.g. passed 5s and non-passed 3s for 7 objects, or passed 6s and non-passed 4s for 9 objects), and the two jugglers don't pass at the same time: one person's right hand throws a pass at the same time as the other person's right hand throws a non-passed throw. To start the pattern, the person holding more objects starts juggling by throwing a pass, and the other person makes their first throw (a pass) at the same time as the first person makes their third throw.     5 ball 4-count <(2x,4xp)|(2x,2x)><(2x,2x)|(2x,4xp)>   6 ball 4-count <3p|3p><3|3><3|3><3|3>   7 ball 4-count <5p|3><3|3><3|5p><3|3>     8 ball 4-count <(4x,4xp)|(4x,4xp)><(4,4)|(4,4)>   9 ball 4-count <(4x,6xp)|(4,4)><(4,4)|(4x,6xp)>   10 ball 4-count <5p|5p><5|5><5|5><5|5>     See also Edit  1-count  2-count  3-count  6-count     Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/4-count?oldid=19659 \"     "

Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does a high non-crossing throw (a 6), and the left hand does a low crossing throw (a 4x). Then the same throws are repeated, but with the left hand throwing a 6 and the right hand throwing a 4x. The high throws should be almost three times as high as the low throws. The simplest way to transition from a cascade to (6,4x)* is to make two crossing 6 ball height throws from one hand in the cascade : ...5555555555 6x56x1x (6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade , do a pair of (6,4x) throws with the higher throw at 7 ball height (but still not crossing), and then a normal pair of (6,4x) throws: ...(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6) (7x,4x)(4x,6)(1x,5)! 5555555555... (The 7x is a non-crossing 7-height throw, and the (1x,5) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (1x,5) pair.)   Transition animation   You can switch between (6x,4)* and (6,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate throwing two objects to the left and throwing two objects to the right. Most of the high throws for a 360 in a (6,4x)* pattern are pairs of (8,6x) throws, but for a 3-up or 5-up 360 , the first pair of high throws is (8,4x): a 3-up is (8,4x)(6x,8)(2,2) , and a 5-up is (8,4x)(6x,8)(8,6x)(0,0) . A 4-up 360 can be done with only (8,6x)s , without an (8,4x): (8,6x)(6x,8)(0,2) .

      "description": "         Five-handed patterns can be done by passing between three people, with two of them using both hands and the other only using one hand, by passing between between four people, with one of them using both hands and the others each using one hand, or by passing between five people, with each of them only using one hand. There are five basic patterns for five-handed passing. In the patterns described below, every throw is the same height, the throws are continually made by the five hands in a certain order on an even rhythm, and each hand always throws to the next hand to the right, so the objects are slowly moving counter-clockwise as viewed from above.  For a number of objects that is one more than a multiple of five (6, 11, 16...): The order the hands throw in is counter-clockwise. Each throw is made by the next hand to the right of the hand that made the previous throw. For a number of objects that is two more than a multiple of five (7, 12, 17...): Each throw is made by the hand that is two hands to the left of the hand that made the previous throw. For a number of objects that is two less than a multiple of five (8, 13, 18...): Each throw is made by the hand that is two hands to the right of the hand that made the previous throw. For a number of objects that is one less than a multiple of five (9, 14, 19...): The order the hands throw in is clockwise. Each throw is made by the next hand to the left of the hand that made the previous throw. For a number of objects that is a multiple of five (10, 15, 20...): All five hands throw at the same time.     6 balls in 5 hands (a domino pattern )   7 balls in 5 hands   8 balls in 5 hands     9 balls in 5 hands   10 balls in 5 hands   11 balls in 5 hands   Another way to do five-handed patterns is for the hands to throw in the same order for all numbers, but throw to different hands depending on the number of objects. If the hands always throw in a counter-clockwise order, the hand that each hand throws to is...  For one more object than a multiple of 5: The next hand to the right. For two more objects than a multiple of 5: Two hands to the right. For two less objects than a multiple of 5: Two hands to the left. For one less object than a multiple of 5: The next hand to the left. For a multiple of 5: Itself.

This throw goes down through the pattern diagonally and is caught (usually in the opposite hand) in the normal position, below the last object thrown from the hand that catches it. A reverse slam is made from a normal position, going under the next object that will be caught by the hand doing the reverse slam. It goes up through the pattern diagonally and is caught above the last object thrown from the hand that catches it. Slams are most commonly done in patterns where they have a siteswap value of 2x, but they can also be done as 1s, 2s, or 3s. The shuffle is a shower pattern done with slams, and Luke's shuffle (invented by Luke Gravett ) is a box done with slams. The slow shuffle and the Boston shuffle are easier versions of these tricks, where instead of doing slams on every beat, the slams are separated by a beat where you just do a basic crossing throw. The N-box is a box where you alternate doing slams and reverse slams.

The diabolos are pushed off the string from one side of the pattern so they go over the other diabolos, then caught on the string on the other side and pushed back over to the throwing side of the string, so they go around in a low circle. Another way to juggle multiple diabolos besides the shuffle is in a high pattern, where the diabolos are thrown higher, one at a time, and there is never more than one on the string at once, as opposed to the low pattern (the shuffle), where there can be more than one diabolo on the string at the same time. 5 is the highest number of diabolos that have been qualified in the low pattern, and 6 is the highest number that have been done for at least a flash .      5 Diabolos 135 catches World Record !!  5 diabolo shuffle by Liao Wang      Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Shuffle_(diabolo)?oldid=21641 \"     "

The lines of jugglers are staggered so that no one is standing directly in front of someone else. Except for the two people farthest from the center of this formation, each person juggles like they would if they were the feeder in a 3-person feed : They pass with the two people in front of them, alternately throwing to the left and to the right. Every time the feeders pass, either all of them throw to their left or all of them throw to their right. The two people at the ends each have only one person to pass to, so they juggle like the feedees in a 3-person feed. If the feeders are doing 2-counts , the people at the ends do 4-counts . In an extended feed with an even number of people, the two people at the ends pass at the same time. In an extended feed with an odd number of people, the people at the ends juggle out of time with each other like the feedees in a 3-person feed: Whenever one of them is passing to a feeder, the other one is doing a self throw.      4-person extended feed (also called an N-feed)  5-person extended feed (also called a W -feed)   6-person extended feed       SJRI 9p Extended Feed  9 person extended feed      Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Extended_feed?oldid=12105 \"     "

Both hands throw at the same time, and each object is thrown at an angle, moving across from one hand to the other. All the objects are thrown to about the same height. The basic synch crossing pattern is called the \"wimpy pattern\" because it's easier than the standard fountain pattern for juggling high even numbers of balls . Collisions can be avoided by throwing slightly higher with one hand, by throwing with one hand farther forward than the other, by making the throws not quite synchronous, or by just aiming to try to make the balls collide. The wimpy pattern with rings or clubs is more difficult than a fountain because those props are too big to easily avoid collisions. It's easier to do a reverse wimpy pattern with the rings or clubs turned sideways than to do a wimpy pattern with normal inside throws with those props. A wimpy pattern is written in siteswap notation as two of the same even number, inside parentheses and separated with a comma, with an \"x\" after each number. The wimpy pattern is the most common way to juggle an even number of props in bounce juggling and one-sided overhead throws . The highest number of objects that have been qualified (at least twice as many catches as objects) in the wimpy pattern is 10 balls (for both toss juggling and bounce juggling ), and the highest number of objects that have been flashed (same number of throws and catches as objects) in the wimpy pattern is 12 balls (for both toss juggling and bounce juggling).

In his book, Charlie Dancey claims that the trick came to him in a dream, but when he woke up he couldn't remember exactly what it was. He describes the trick as \"a four or five ball pattern with the looping features of Rubenstein's revenge combined with multiplex throws of varying kinds\".

In a box with switched columns , the right hand throws a ball in a column on the left side of the pattern, and the left hand throws a ball in a column on the right side. In a box with \" switched zips \", the ball that zips back and forth between the hands moves in the direction corresponding to the hand throwing the zip, instead of the direction of the hand that will catch it. A zip going from the right hand to the left hand goes from the left side of the pattern to the right side and vice-versa, so to catch the zips in the right position the hands have to keep moving to the other side of the pattern after throwing a column ball, and then back to the other side to catch the column. In both of these box variations, both hands throw and catch on the same side of the pattern at the same time. It's also possible to do the box with both the columns and the zips switched. In this pattern, a completely \"switched\" box, the hands are always on opposite sides of the pattern while they're throwing and catching, like in a normal box, but with the arms crossed , so all the throws and catches on the right side of the pattern are made by the left hand and vice-versa. In a normal box, a full switched box, an upside-down box with switched columns, an upside-down box with switched zips, or a true box , the balls stay away from each other so that they are always in different corners of the box. In a box with switched columns, a box with switched zips, an upside-down box, or a full switched upside-down box, two balls come together in the same corner of the box on each beat, while the other ball is in the opposite corner.

Four balls are juggled in a fountain at 8 ball height, while the other two balls alternate going up and down at 4 ball height. Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does an 8 (twice as high as the 6 ball fountain), and the left hand does a 4 (about a third of the height of the 6 ball fountain). Then in the next pair of throws, the left hand throws an 8 and the right hand throws a 4. The 8s should be around 5 times as high as the 4s, and each 8 should peak at the same time as the next 4 thrown by the same hand.

To transition from a synch fountain to (8,4)*, throw an 8 from one hand while throwing a 6 from the other hand, and then start the (8,4)* pattern by throwing the 8 with the hand that did the 6 in the pair of transition throws: ...(6,6)(6,6)(6,6) (8,6) (4,8)(8,4)(4,8)(8,4)(4,8)(8,4)... To transition back to the fountain, make a high throw from one hand and a low throw (a 4) from the other hand, throwing high with the same hand that would throw high if you were continuing the (8,4)* pattern, but do the high throw at 6 ball height instead of 8 ball height: ...(4,8)(8,4)(4,8)(8,4)(4,8)(8,4) (4,6) (6,6)(6,6)(6,6)...   Transition animation   You can switch between (8,4)* and (8x,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate making a high throw that goes to the left and making a high throw that goes to the right. To do a 360 in (8,4)*, you have to start the high throws with (a,4)(4,a) instead of (a,6)(6,a) to keep the lower of the high throws from coming down too soon.

      "description": "         Three-handed patterns can be done by passing between two people, with one of them using both hands and the other only using one hand, or by passing between three people, with each of them only using one hand. There are three basic patterns you can use, depending on how many objects you're juggling. In these patterns every throw should be the same height, and each hand always throws to the next hand to the right (or each hand always throws to the next hand to the left if you decide to do it in the other direction), so if one person is using both hands and passing right-handed, the objects go around in a circle counter-clockwise.  For a number of objects that is one more than a multiple of three (4, 7, 10...): One hand throws at a time, and the order of the hands is the same as the direction the objects are going. If the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is counter-clockwise (left hand, right hand, partner's hand). For a number of objects that is one less than a multiple of three (5, 8, 11...): One hand throws at a time, and the order of the hands is the opposite of the direction the objects are going. If the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is clockwise (right hand, left hand, partner's hand). For a number of objects that is a multiple of three (6, 9, 12...): All three hands throw at the same time.     4 balls in 3 hands (a domino pattern )   5 balls in 3 hands   6 balls in 3 hands   Siteswaps Edit  Vanilla siteswaps can be interpreted as three-handed patterns. If you do a siteswap with the hands throwing in a counter-clockwise order, any number that is one more than a multiple of three is a throw that goes to the next hand to the right, any number that is one less than a multiple of three is a throw that goes to the next hand to the left, and any number that is a multiple of three is a throw that comes back to the same hand that threw it. A 0 is a beat with an empty hand, a 1 or a 2 is an object handed straight into another hand, a 3 is a pause with an object held in the hand, and any higher number should be thrown to the same height you would throw if you were doing the basic three-handed pattern for that number of objects at the same speed you're doing the siteswap.     552    744    64    See also Edit  One-handed patterns  Five-handed patterns     Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Three-handed_patterns?oldid=19489 \"     "

The balls don't stay in the same columns - when a ball is caught, it's usually moved to a different column. The throws are made alternately with the right and left hands. Three throws are made in two columns on the right side of the pattern, starting with the left hand, and then three throws are made in two columns on the left side of the pattern, starting with the right hand. The first two throws in each of these sets of three are active 2s, so they quickly bounce right back into the same hands that threw them. The last throw made before moving to the other side of the pattern is a 5, which bounces twice before it's caught. The second 2 thrown after a 5 should bounce at the same time as the 5 does its second bounce.    Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Dyer%27s_straights?oldid=19459 \"     "

Contents [ show ]  3 ball slow cascades Edit  There are twelve different ways to notate the 3 ball cascade (defined as a 3 ball pattern where the two hands alternately make crossing throws at a fixed height on an even rhythm) in siteswap with a maximum throw value of 9:  3  (4x,2)*  522  (6x,2)(2,2)*  (6x,0)*  72222  720  (8x,2)(2,2)(2,2)*  (8x,2)(0,2)*  9222222  92022  900   All of these siteswaps represent essentially the same pattern, but the different ways of writing it imply different heights and dwell times . If higher throws, uneven rhythms, or varied throw heights are allowed, then there are more ways to write the pattern, such as b22222222 , 5520 , and 722520 .   Video : 65 variations of (4x,2)* with active 2s  Synonyms for other basic patterns Edit  The 4 ball asynch fountain can be written with a maximum throw value of 8 as:  4  (6,2)*  822  (8,0)*   The 4 ball synch fountain can be written with a maximum throw value of 8 as:  (4,4)  (6,6)(2,2)  (8,8)(2,2)(2,2)  (8,8)(0,0)   The 5 ball cascade can only be written two ways without exceeding a throw value of 9: 5 and (8x,2)* . Other ways to write this pattern using higher throws include:  (ax,0)*  b22  d20  (ex,2)(2,2)*  f00  (gx,2)(0,2)*  h2222  (kx,0)(0,0)*   Repetitions, rotations, and reflections Edit  A siteswap can also be written in different ways by repeating the sequence of numbers: 744 , 744744, 744744744, etc. all represent the same pattern, but a siteswap pattern is normally expressed in the shortest possible form (no repetition). Patterns containing more than one throw height, such as \"...123451234512345...\", can be written several different ways without repetition, since a variety of starting points are possible for the notation. 12345 , 23451, 34512, 45123, and 51234 all represent the same pattern, since they all look the same when written as an indefinitely repeating sequence. Switching the numbers in each pair of throws in a synchronous pattern, for example changing (6x,4)(2,4x) to (4,6x)(4x,2), results in another way of writing the same pattern. If you consider the number to the left of a comma to always be a left hand throw (or if you consider the number to the left of a comma to always be a right hand throw), then the new notation represents the mirror-image version of the original pattern.  Synch, asynch, and one-handed patterns Edit  A shower pattern can be written either in asynchronous notation or in synchronous notation. There is not much difference between the asynch patterns 51 , 71 , 91 , and the synch patterns (4x,2x) , (6x,2x) , (8x,2x) , and in practice the shower is commonly done with a rhythm in between synch and asynch. (Jugglers usually use a high dwell time , which makes it impossible to do 1s with a perfect asynch rhythm.) Sprung patterns , which are normally written in synchronous notation, can also be written as asynch patterns ( e.g. 612 instead of (4,2x)* and 912 instead of (6x,2x)* ). One-handed patterns are exactly the same whether they're written in asynch notation or in synch notation since one hand isn't doing anything, so there are no throws to be synchronized. If the 0 in the siteswap for a one-handed pattern is replaced with a 2, there is still no difference in the pattern except that the hand that isn't juggling is now holding an object. So 2 in 1 hand can be written as 40 , (4,0) , 42 , or (4,2) , 3 in 1 hand can be written as 60 , (6,0) , 62 , or (6,2) , and 4 in 1 hand can be written as 80 , (8,0) , 82 , or (8,2) .      42 ~ Three Ball Siteswap  3 ball 42 by Robert Wood      Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Siteswap_synonyms?oldid=20137 \"     "

The right hand throws another ball straight up, to the right of the last ball it threw, while the left hand (which should now be farther to the right than the right hand) drops the ball it's been holding down to be caught in the right hand, and then quickly moves back to the left side of the pattern to claw the ball that was thrown on beat 2.  Make sure your hand stops moving horizontally before you drop the ball, so it will fall straight down.  Alternative names Edit  Machine Robot Droppings  Variations Edit  Alternating factory: Do the same three beats described above, but alternate doing the right-handed version and the left-handed version. Reverse factory Relf's factory  Cross-armed factory  2-beat factory (the pendulum ): The right hand throws a ball straight up on the left side of the pattern, while the left hand carries the ball it's holding horizontally across the top of the pattern, crossing over to the right side of the pattern. The right hand throws another ball straight up, to the right of the last ball it threw, while the left hand (which is now farther to the right than the right hand) drops the ball it's been holding down to be caught in the right hand, and then quickly moves back to the left side of the pattern to claw the ball that was thrown on beat 1.  1-beat factory (the waterfall ): The right hand throws a ball up to the left side of the pattern, while the left hand carries the ball it's holding horizontally across the top of the pattern, crossing over to the right side of the pattern, drops the ball down to be caught in the right hand, and then quickly moves back to the left side of the pattern to claw the ball that was thrown from the right hand. This is easiest when done in an asynch pattern ( siteswap  3 ) with two distinct \"beats\": throw and carry, then drop and claw. The waterfall is not always done with claw catches.

Slapbacks were first performed by Bob Dupont in the 1940s.

Koblikov 10 balls pirouette !!!  10 ball stacked 10 up 360 by Alexander Koblikov     A stack is a multiplex throw where all the objects are thrown to the same hand (not necessarily the same hand that threw them), typically done so that the objects are \"stacked\" vertically in the air. In a self stack, all the objects return to the hand that threw them, and in a crossing stack, all the objects cross over to the other hand. A clustered multiplex is a stacked throw where all the objects being thrown are treated as one object, so they will all be gathered into one hand before any of them is thrown again. A clustered duplex is written in siteswap notation using two of the same number ( e.g. [33], [44], [55] ). A non-multiplex pattern can be made into a multiplex pattern using twice as many objects by making every throw a duplex cluster. Any composite number of objects can be juggled in a multiplex pattern similar to a basic non-multiplex pattern by throwing the same kind of clustered stack for every throw. A cut multiplex is a stack where one of the objects is caught and thrown again before catching any other objects that were part of that throw. A cut duplex is written in siteswap using either two different odd numbers ( e.g. [53], [73], [75] ) or two different even numbers ( e.g. [64], [84], [86] ).     6 ball duplex stacks Siteswap: [33]   6 ball asynch cut duplexes Siteswap: [42T] or ([64],2)*   6 ball synch cut duplexes Siteswap: ([42T],[42T]) or ([64],[64])(2,2)     8 ball asynch duplex stacks Siteswap: [44]   8 ball synch duplex stacks Siteswap: ([44],[44])   9 ball triplex stacks Siteswap: [333]     10 ball duplex stacks Siteswap: [55]   12 ball duplex stacks Siteswap: [66]   12 ball triplex stacks Siteswap: [444]         Secret Extra Throws!

Each throw goes underneath the incoming ball. In a cascade done with outside throws , the balls are thrown on the outside of the pattern and caught on the inside.

In siteswap notation, a gap (a beat with an empty hand) is a 0. Patterns with gaps (e.g. 55550 ) can be used as exercises to prepare for the full patterns (e.g. 5 ).      4 ball synch fountain with a gap Siteswap: (4,4)(4,0)      4 ball wimpy pattern with a gap Siteswap: (4x,4x)(4x,0)*      5 ball cascade with a two consecutive gaps (3 ball flashes ) Siteswap: 55500      5 ball cascade with a two nonconsecutive gaps (3 ball snake ) Siteswap: 50505   Sometimes if an object is removed from a siteswap to make a gap pattern, the new pattern takes more beats than the original pattern before it repeats. The notation for 534 without the ball that is always thrown as a 3 ( 504 ) is a period 3 sequence like the original pattern, but removing any of the other balls results in the period 9 pattern 534034530 .

In a 2-person 2-count with an even number of objects, each person does a cascade or a wimpy pattern with every right-hand (or left-hand) throw passed to the other person's left (or right) hand. The two jugglers' throws are synchronized, so that both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. If both people are juggling synchronous patterns, all four hands throw at the same time. An 8 (or 12 or 16) object 2-count is normally done synch, but it can also be done asynch by making the passes higher than the other throws, e.g. 8 objects in a 53 pattern (passing the 5s). A 10 (or 14 or 18) object 2-count is normally done asynch, but it can be done synch by making the passes higher than the other throws, e.g. 10 objects in a (6x,4x) pattern. The 2-count pattern for 7 balls is the same as a 6 ball 2-count except the passes are at 4 ball height instead of 3 ball height, and the hands are synchronized differently: one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand. To start the pattern, the person holding more balls throws one pass first, and then the other person makes their first throw (a pass) at the same time as the first person makes their second throw. 11 or 15 balls are done the same way, but with higher throws: 6s and 5 for 11, and 8s and 7s for 15. A 9 ball 2-count is the same as an 8 ball 2-count except the passes are at 5 ball height instead of 4 ball height, and the hands are synchronized differently: the jugglers take turns throwing with both hands at the same time. Like the 7 ball 2-count, the pattern starts with the person holding more balls throwing one pass first, before the other person starts throwing. 13 or 17 balls are done the same way, but with higher throws: 7s and 6s for 13, and 9s and 8 for 17.     5 ball asynch 2-count <(4x,2)|(2,2)><(2,4xp)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(4x,2)><(2,2)|(2,4xp)>   5 ball synch 2-count <(3p,2x)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3p,2x)!>   6 ball asynch 2-count <3p|3p><3|3>     6 ball synch 2-count <(2x,4xp)|(2x,4xp)>   7 ball 2-count <R|L><4xp|3><3|4xp>   8 ball synch 2-count <(4x,4xp)|(4x,4xp)>     8 ball asynch 2-count <5p|5p><3|3>   9 ball synch 2-count <(5p,4x)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(5p,4x)!>   9 ball asynch 2-count <R|L><6xp|3><3|6xp>     10 ball asynch 2-count <5p|5p><5|5>   10 ball synch 2-count <(4x,6xp)|(4x,6xp)>   9 ball triangle 2-count <3p|3p|3p><3|3|3>         14 Balls 199 Catches  14 ball 2-count by Chris and Andrew Hodge    Alternative names Edit  Solids Everys (because every right-hand (or left-hand) throw is a pass) Shower  See also Edit  1-count  3-count  4-count  6-count     Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/2-count?oldid=19657 \"     "

Instead of changing direction every 3 throws like the normal Mills mess, this pattern changes direction every 5 throws. After a normal under the arm throw, the arms keep moving around each other in the same direction so that they cross again, wrapping all the way around each other so the right hand is to the right of the left hand again while the arms are crossed. The next throw is different kind of under the arm throw: if it's a right hand throw, the right hand is reaching under the left arm from left to right instead of from right to left. After that throw, the pattern changes direction in the same way as Mills mess, except the arms are still crossed twice. The arms stay wrapped around until the hand that just threw makes its next catch in the same position, and then during the next throw the arms start uncrossing.

The siteswap notation for an asynch pseudoshower has even-number throws alternating with 1s and an odd period, instead of having odd-number throws alternating with 1s and an even period like a shower. One hand keeps making high non-crossing throws while the other hand passes objects to it, until the throwing hand has thrown all but one object, and then the pattern changes direction so that the other hand throws high. Any given even number can be used in a siteswap pattern to make two different asynch pseudoshowers: in a superior pseudoshower , the siteswap sequence starts and ends with the even number (e.g. 61616 ), so there are two high throws in a row when the pattern is done continuously, and in an inferior pseudoshower , the sequence starts and ends with a 1 (e.g. 16161 ), so there are two 1s in a row when the pattern is done continuously. A superior pseudoshower is done with one more object than the inferior pseudoshower that uses the same even-number throw.      3 ball superior pseudoshower Siteswap: 414       3 ball inferior pseudoshower Siteswap: 16161      4 ball superior pseudoshower Siteswap: 61616      4 ball inferior pseudoshower Siteswap: 1818181      5 ball superior pseudoshower Siteswap: 8181818      5 ball inferior pseudoshower Siteswap: 1a1a1a1a1   A synch pseudoshower is a kind of box pattern, where one hand throws all but two objects high before the pattern changes direction.      3 ball synch pseudoshower Siteswap: (4,2x)*       4 ball synch pseudoshower Siteswap: (6,2x)(6,2x)*      5 ball synch pseudoshower Siteswap: (8,2x)(8,2x)(8,2x)*   Siteswap exercises Edit  You can use these exercises to practice the same kinds of throws and sequences of throws that are done in pseudoshower patterns, before you learn the full pattern.

Video : 100 catches of 6 ball (8x,4x)* by Paweł Witczak    Video : 6 ball (8x,4x)* with the 4s blind behind the back by Łukasz Uczkiewicz   This is an excited state siteswap, so you can't go directly into it from the basic pattern . To transition from a synch fountain to (8x,4x)*, throw an 8x from one hand while throwing a 6x from the other hand, and then start the (8x,4x)* pattern by throwing the 8x with the hand that did the 6x in the pair of transition throws: ...(6,6)(6,6)(6,6) (8x,6x) (4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x)... To transition back to the fountain, make a high throw from one hand and a low throw (a 4x) from the other hand, throwing high with the same hand that would throw high if you were continuing the (8x,4x)* pattern, but do the high throw at 6 ball height instead of 8 ball height: ...(4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x) (4x,6x) (6,6)(6,6)(6,6)...   Transition animation   You can switch between (8,4)* and (8x,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate making a high throw that goes to the left and making a high throw that goes to the right. To do a 360 in (8x,4x)*, you have to start the high throws with (ax,4x)(4x,ax) instead of (ax,6x)(6x,ax) to keep the lower of the high throws from coming down too soon. The rest of the high throws are (ax,6x) pairs. A 4 up is (ax,4x)(4x,ax)(ax,6x)(2,2) , and a 6 up is (ax,4x)(4x,ax)(ax,6x)(6x,ax)(0,0) .

      "description": "         This article is about between the leg throws. For other kinds of throws that go around part of the body, see Category: Body moves .   Body throws are throws that go between the legs while both feet stay on the ground. This trick was invented by Morris Cronin and is most commonly done with 3 clubs in single  spins , with the clubs going between the legs from front to back. For a normal front-to-back body throw, a club starts in front of the juggler, and is brought back between the legs and thrown from this position behind the juggler, and then it comes forward over the opposite shoulder and is caught in front of the juggler. In a back-to-front body throw, a club is brought behind the back, thrown between the legs from back to front, and caught in front with the opposite hand. These throws are often called \"reverse body throws\", but they're not actually time-reversed body throws - a front-to-back body throw in reverse would be something like a blind catch .      5 Club 3up Crotch Throw 360 Extra  3 and 5 club body throw tricks by David Ferman    World records Edit  Body throw world records with publicly available video evidence: Front-to-back body throws   3 balls : 12 catches by Malthe Jerup in 2012 ( video ) 3 rings : 6 catches by Delaney Bayles in 2018 ( video ) 3 clubs: 4 minutes and 33 seconds by Ameron Rosvall in 2013 ( video ) 4 clubs: 8 catches by Kenny Cheung in 2016 ( video ) 5 clubs: 19 catches by Masahiro Takahashi in 2016 ( video )  Back-to-front body throws   3 balls: 26 catches by Kenny Cheung in 2016 ( video ) 3 clubs: 1 minute and 52 seconds by Ameron Rosvall in 2011 ( video ) 4 clubs: 4 catches by Anthony Gatto in 2005 ( video ), Ameron Rosvall in 2010 ( video ), and Kenny Cheung in 2018 ( video ) 5 clubs: 5 catches by Anthony Gatto in 2006 ( video at 58:55)  Unverified claims:  3 clubs: 499 catches by Ameron Rosvall in 2012 ( claim )  Alternative names Edit  Kit Summers named this trick after Albert Lucas in his 1987 book Juggling with Finesse , because Albert was the first person he had seen doing that trick. He called front-to-back body throws Alberts , and back-to-front body throws Treblas . (\"Trebla\" is \"Albert\" spelled backwards.) In 2000 Jason Garfield , who disapproved of people giving Albert credit for a trick he didn't invent, introduced a new name for the trick, crotch throws , and later the euphemism body throws (which is an ambiguous name since some jugglers use the term \"body throws\" more generally, for any kinds of trick throws that go around some part of the body). Between the leg throws is a longer, but more descriptive and less ambiguous name than \"body throws\". A less common name for body throws is butterflies .  Variations Edit  Crotch madness - Every third throw is a back-to-front crotch throw, and the rest are front-to-back.

      "description": "         The Boston mess is a pattern where the arms cross and uncross like in Mills mess , but the three balls go straight up and down in three separate columns .    Half Boston mess reaching over the arm Half Boston mess reaching under the arm    3 ball full Boston mess 4 ball Boston mess  Start with two balls in your right hand and one in your left hand. Throw the first two balls straight up, one from the right hand and then one the left hand, and cross your arms so you can catch the ball on the right with your left hand, on the right side of the pattern. With your arms still crossed, throw the next ball from your right hand straight up through the middle of the pattern, and catch the ball on the left with your right hand, on the left side of the pattern. Now throw the right-column and left-column balls straight up again, but since your arms are still crossed, this time you throw the ball on the right with your left hand, and the ball on the left with your right hand. Uncross your arms so you can catch the ball on the right with your right hand, throw the middle ball straight up with your left hand, and catch the ball on the left in your left hand. Then you can repeat the pattern. This is a half Boston mess, which can be done two different ways: when you cross your arms, your left arm can go either over your right arm, or under it. To do the full Boston mess, alternate crossing your left arm over and under your right arm. This results in a 12-beat pattern:  Right hand throws in right column & (unless you're just starting the pattern) catches in middle column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arm on top Right hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arm underneath Left hand throws in right column & catches in middle column with arm on top Right hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arms uncrossed Right hand throws in right column & catches in middle column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arm underneath Right hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arm on top Left hand throws in right column & catches in middle column with arm underneath Right hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arms uncrossed (return to top of list)  This is not a symmetrical pattern - the throws keep going through the columns from left to right: right-left-middle-right-left-middle-right-left-middle-right... Doing a Boston mess with right and left reversed (follow all the instructions above replacing right with left and left with right) is the same as doing the time-reversed version of the pattern.

The basic patterns for 6 and 7 clubs are normally done with triple rotations. A few jugglers also use triples for 8 clubs, which are more commonly done with quads . 720s with 3 clubs and 360s with 4 and 5 clubs are normally done with triples for the high throws. Juggling with 3, 4, or 5 clubs in triple rotations is a more difficult trick than the basic patterns, which are normally done with singles for 3 clubs and doubles for 4 and 5. Those numbers can be done with triples at their normal heights, using fast spins , or in a higher, slower pattern, with the same kinds of throws used in a 6 or 7 club pattern. High triples with lower numbers can be used as an exercise to prepare for learning 6 or 7 clubs.

There is one object that is always thrown with the right hand, and one that is always thrown with the left hand. After the right hand throws the first object, it catches the second object and passes it across to the left hand before the first object is caught. Then the left hand throws the second object, catches the first object, and passes it back over to the right hand before the second object is caught, and the pattern repeats. This is an excited state siteswap, starting in the state 101.

It can be done in any 2-handed period 2 crossing siteswap that isn't a shower . If one hand throws higher than the other, that hand does outside throws.   5 ball halfshower 3 up 360 animation    5 ball halfshower 5 up 360 animation   Outside throws with rings and clubs are normally done with the props turned sideways ( flat fronts ). In a halfshower, the flat fronts can be thrown behind the other throws to avoid collisions. You can transition from a 5 ball  cascade to the synch halfshower (6x,4x) the same way you would transition to (6x,4)* - make two crossing throws from one hand in the cascade at 6 ball height: ...5555555555 6x56x1x (6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade , do a pair of (6x,4x) throws with the lower throw at 5 ball height: ...(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x) (6x,5)(1x,5)! 5555555555... (The (1x,5) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (1x,5) pair.)   Siteswap transition animation   The term \"halfshower\" is also sometimes used for crossing patterns where one hand throws higher than the other without doing outside throws. Some jugglers find this to be the easiest way to juggle an even number of objects, especially 6 clubs .

      "description": "         Mills mess is a trick invented by Steve Mills . The pattern is a repeating sequence of three different kinds of throws:      7b mills attempt  7 ball Mills mess by Daniel Eaker    The first throw is an outside throw . The next catch made by the hand making this throw should be done with that arm crossed over the other arm. The second throw is made under the arm , and the arms stay crossed so that the next catch made by that hand is also done under the arm. The third throw is made starting with the arms crossed , uncrossing them while throwing with the hand that's on top. This prop , when thrown with the right hand, goes over the top of the pattern from left to right. The next catch made by the hand making this throw should be done with the arms uncrossed.  These three throws are done starting with the right hand and the left hand alternately. Unless this trick is combined with a siteswap , in a Mills mess pattern with an odd number of objects the objects are always thrown with one hand and caught with the other hand, and in a pattern with an even number of objects each object is always thrown and caught with the same hand. Because all the throws are made on the outside of the pattern, it's easier to transition into Mills mess from a reverse cascade or fountain than from the basic pattern .     3 ball Mills mess   4 ball Mills mess   5 ball Mills mess       Three Ball Mills Mess Tutorial  3 ball Mills mess tutorial       Juggling Tutorial 4 ball Mills' Mess - part I  4 ball Mills mess tutorial ( part 1 , part 2 , part 3 )    World records Edit  Mills mess records with publicly available video evidence:  3 ball Mills mess: 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 9 seconds by Luka Tchernia in 2017 ( video ) 4 ball Mills mess: 21 minutes and 22 seconds by Dominik Braun in 2018 ( video ) 5 ball Mills mess: 10 minutes and 43 seconds by Thomas Dietz in 2009 ( video ) 6 ball Mills mess: 146 catches by Josiah Jones in 2007 ( video ) 7 ball Mills mess: 22 catches by Michael Pearce in 2018 ( video )  4 ring Mills mess: 1 minute and 32 seconds by Marc Schneider in 2015 ( video ) 5 ring Mills mess: 38 catches by Kip Hunt in 2014 ( video )  3 club Mills mess: 26 minutes by Kip Hunt in 2014 ( video ) 4 club Mills mess: 2 minutes and 44 seconds by Marc Schneider in 2018 ( video ) 5 club Mills mess: 79 catches by Toby Walker in 2008 ( video ) 6 club Mills mess: 12 catches by Toby Walker in 2011 ( video )  Unverified claims:  3 ball Mills mess: 2 hours and 30 minutes by Luka Tchernia in 2016 ( claim ) 6 ball Mills mess: 850 catches by Josiah Jones ( claim ) 7 ball Mills mess: 24 catches by Josiah Jones in 2007 ( claim ) 8 ball Mills mess: 12 catches by Nick Thomas ( claim ) 9 ball Mills mess: 11 catches by Nick Thomas ( claim )  Alternative names Edit  Mills Mess Alternating cross-armed pattern Pretzel  Variations Edit     Flo's mess  After the under-the-arm throw, you uncross your arms and do an outside throw instead of doing a cross-armed throw.

The throws are made with the arms crossed , changing which hand is on top each time, and the catches are made with the arms uncrossed. The throws in this pattern look like crossing throws, but each ball is actually caught by the same hand that threw it, because it is thrown with the arms crossed and caught with the arms uncrossed. 5 ball Burke's Burrage is a multiplex pattern with the siteswap [44][22]3. It is a combination of Burke's barrage (a 423 pattern where a ball is carried through the middle of the pattern, under the 4) and takeouts (a variation of Burke's barrage where the ball is carried over the 4). In 5 ball Burke's Burrage, each 4 is replaced with a stacked multiplex - a [44] - so the balls can be carried under one 4 and over the other, through the middle of the stack.

In siteswap notation, the double box is (4x,2x)(4,2x)* , which means a shower pattern (4x,2x) with a non-crossing throw on every other beat, which makes the shower change direction on the next beat. Keeping the 4x ball in a column in the middle and throwing the 4s in two more columns on the sides gives the pattern the shape of two boxes next to each other. Before you learn the double box you should already be good at the normal box , and showers in both directions.  Variations Edit  You can add more shower beats to make patterns with more than two boxes, such as the triple box - siteswap (4x,2x)(4x,2x)(4,2x)* .      53 Amazing Double-Shower Variations!

In the fountain pattern, two one-handed patterns are done at the same time, with each hand juggling half of the objects, so the objects never cross from one hand to the other. Each object is thrown at a slight angle away from the center of the body, so that it is caught on the outside of the pattern by the same hand that threw it. All the objects are thrown to the same height. Fountains are the most common patterns for juggling even numbers of objects. In the asynch fountain, the hands throw one at a time, on an even, alternating rhythm. In the synch fountain, both hands throw at the same time. An asynch fountain is represented in siteswap notation as a single even number. A synch fountain is written as two of the same even number, inside parentheses and separated with a comma. Before learning a 4 ball fountain, you should already be good at 2 in one hand , 441 , and 4 with a gap (starting each one from both sides). Before learning a 6 ball fountain, you should already be good at 3 balls in one hand (with each hand), 4 ball high flashes , 6662 or (6,6)(6,2) , and 6 with a gap (starting each one from both sides). You can switch a fountain pattern from asynch to synch or synch to asynch, by throwing all or all but one of the objects on one side higher than the rest of the pattern (e.g. throwing 2 or 3 balls from the right hand at 7 ball height in a 6 ball fountain).   4 ball fountain transition animation    6 ball fountain transition animation   The highest number of objects that have been qualified (at least twice as many catches as objects) in a fountain is 10 ( balls and rings , synch and asynch), and the highest number of objects that have been flashed (same number of throws and catches as objects) in a fountain is 14 balls (asynch, by Alex Barron ).

A split is a multiplex throw where some of the objects are thrown to the right hand, and some to the left hand. In the simplest case, a duplex split, two objects are thrown from one hand and split apart in the air so that one object lands in each hand. Any split throw involving more than two objects contains at least one stack . A triplex where one object is caught in one hand and two are caught in the other hand is a split multiplex, but the two objects that are caught in the same hand are \"stacked\". In an \"inside\" split triplex, one object is thrown across to the other hand and the other two are thrown as a self stack, and in an \"outside\" split triplex, one object is thrown as a self throw and the other two are thrown as a crossing stack.

Higher numbers are normally done with the clubs rotating at least three times per throw, and juggling those numbers with double rotations is a more difficult trick. Throw height and rotation speed can be controlled separately, so doubles with more than 5 clubs do not have to be done any lower than the basic patterns with the normal number of rotations. Double rotations with 3 clubs is also a more difficult trick than the basic pattern, which is normally done with singles . 3 club doubles can be done at a normal 3 club height, using fast  spins , or in a higher, slower pattern, with the same kind of throws used in a 5 club pattern, which is a good thing to work on to prepare for learning 5 clubs.

In the windmill, all the throws start on the same side of the pattern and cross over to the other side (from right to left if you throw under the arm with your left hand). This makes the objects follow each other around in a circle, like they do in a shower pattern.

      "description": "         Basic patterns are the simplest kind of juggling patterns. In these patterns, every throw is the same height, and either all the throws cross from one side of the pattern to the other, or none of them do. In most basic patterns, objects are thrown from the inside of the pattern and caught on the outside. Basic patterns have no special kinds of throws or catches like backcrosses , multiplexes , or penguins . There are four basic patterns for two-handed toss juggling :    2-handed basic patterns Asynchronous (One hand throws at a time)  Synchronous (Both hands throw at the same time)    Crossing (Each object is thrown with one hand and caught with the other)    Cascade     Wimpy pattern     Non-crossing (Each object is thrown and caught with the same hand)    Asynch fountain     Synch fountain    The cascade can be done with any odd number of objects, and the wimpy and fountain patterns can be done with any even number. These are the easiest (non- multiplex ) ways to ( toss ) juggle any number of objects. Other juggling patterns are generally variations built on the basic patterns.     4 ball lift bounce    4 ball force bounce    With clubs , the basic pattern is normally done with each throw rotating half as many times as the number of clubs being juggled, rounding down for odd numbers: 3 clubs are done with single rotations, 4 and 5 are done with doubles , 6 and 7 are done with triples , 8 and 9 are done with quads . Any higher or lower number of rotations is usually considered a more difficult trick. There are two kinds of basic patterns for bounce juggling : the lift bounce and the force bounce . Unlike most basic patterns, bounce juggling patterns are normally done with outside throws . Even numbers of balls are usually bounced juggled in a wimpy pattern , rather than a fountain . The basic pattern for one-handed juggling is the \"rolling out\" pattern, where the objects go in an arc to the right (clockwise) if the right hand is being used, or to the left (counter-clockwise) if the left hand is being used.     2 in 1 hand   3 in 1 hand   4 in 1 hand   The 1-count is the most difficult basic pattern for passing , but it is commonly used for passing world records because only the number of passes caught is counted in the records. 2-counts and 4-counts are the most popular basic patterns for passing. An easier pattern for beginning passers is the 6-count .     6 ball 1-count    6 ball 2-count      6 ball 4-count    6 ball 6-count    There are three basic patterns for passing with three hands :     For a number of objects that is 1 more than a multiple of 3, if the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is counter-clockwise.   For a number of objects that is 1 less than a multiple of 3, if the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is clockwise.   For a number of objects that is a multiple of 3, all three hands throw at the same time.   The basic pattern for juggling multiple diabolos is a circular pattern which can be done either high (with only one diabolo on the string at a time) or low (with more than one diabolo one the string at a time, called a shuffle ).

Three balls are juggled in a cascade at 6 ball height, and the other two balls go up and down on the sides of the pattern at 4 ball height. Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does a high crossing throw (a 6x), and the left hand does a low non-crossing throw (a 4). Then the same throws are repeated, but with the left hand throwing a 6x and the right hand throwing a 4. The high throws should be almost three times as high as the low throws.   Video : 5 ball (6x,4)* with the 6s as backcrosses by Daniela Paličková    Video : 5 ring (6x,4)* with the 4s as pancakes by Chris Hodge    Video : 5 club (6x,4)* with the 4s as lazies by Wes Peden   The simplest way to transition from a cascade to (6x,4)* is to make two crossing 6 ball height throws from one hand in the cascade: ...5555555555 6x56x1x (4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade, do a pair of (6x,4) throws with the higher throw at 7 ball height, and then a normal pair of (6x,4) throws: ...(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x) (7,4)(4,6x)(5,1x)! 5555555555... (The (5,1x) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (5,1x) pair.)   Transition animation   You can switch between (6x,4)* and (6,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate throwing two objects to the left and throwing two objects to the right. Most of the high throws for a 360 in a (6x,4)* pattern are pairs of (8x,6) throws, but for a 3-up or 5-up 360, the first pair of high throws is (8x,4): a 3-up is (8x,4)(6,8x)(2,2) , and a 5-up is (8x,4)(6,8x)(8x,6)(0,0) . A 4-up 360 can be done with only (8x,6)s, without an (8x,4): (8x,6)(6,8x)(2,0) .

The throws are made in the positions where the catches were made in the original pattern and vice versa.  Reversed throws and catches Edit  In a basic  cascade , each throw goes under the incoming prop . All the objects are thrown on the inside of the pattern and caught on the outside. The right-hand and left-hand throws cross paths on the way up. In a reverse cascade , each throw goes over the incoming prop. All the objects are thrown on the outside of the pattern and caught on the inside. The right-hand and left-hand throws cross paths on the way down. Clubs are normally thrown so that they rotate with the top moving toward the juggler. Reverse spins are throws where clubs rotate in the opposite direction, with the top of the club moving away from the juggler. A lift bounce and a force bounce are time-reversed versions of each other. In a lift bounce, the balls are caught and thrown while moving upward, and they cross paths on the way down. In a force bounce, the balls are caught and thrown while moving downward, and they cross paths on the way up. A reverse multiplex throw is a squeeze catch - instead of throwing two or more objects from the same hand at the same time, you catch two or more objects in the same hand at the same time. The reverse of an under the arm throw is an under the arm catch, and the reverse of an under the leg throw is an under the leg catch. In backcrosses , the throws are made behind the back and caught in front, coming forward on the same side of the body where they're caught. In reverse backcrosses , the throws are made in front and caught behind the back, going back on the same side of the body where they're thrown. In shoulder throws , the throws are made behind the back and caught in front, coming forward on the same side of the body where they're thrown. In reverse shoulder throws , the throws are made in front and caught behind the back, going back on the same side of the body where they're caught. The time-reversed version of body throws would be continuous blind catches , but the terms \"reverse body throws\" and \"treblas\" (meaning \"reverse Alberts \") are used to refer to a different trick, back-to-front body throws, which are the reverse of normal body throws only in the sense that the clubs go through the legs in the opposite direction. The reverse of a kick-up is a foot catch.  Reversed patterns Edit  The reverse of a right-handed shower is a left-handed shower, and the reverse of a right-handed halfshower is a left-handed halfshower. 3 ball tennis is a cascade with an outside throw every third throw. 3 ball reverse tennis is a reverse cascade with an inside throw every third throw. In the windmill , one hand always throws under the arm, and in the reverse windmill, one hand always catches under the arm. In Mills mess , all the throws are made on the outside of the pattern. A 3 ball reverse Mills mess is the same as a normal Mills mess, except the under the arm throw is made on the inside of the pattern, going up in between the other two balls. The shuffle is a shower with slams , which go down through the pattern diagonally. The reverse shuffle is a shower with reverse slams, which go up through the pattern diagonally. Doing a time-reversed Boston mess is the same as doing the Boston mess with the roles of the right and left hands reversed. In a time-reversed cherry picker , the hands move through the columns in the opposite direction. Jay's jumble and Luke's lobotomy are roughly time-reversed versions of each other.  Reversed siteswaps Edit  Juggling a siteswap in reverse often results in the same siteswap pattern, but sometimes the reverse of a siteswap is a different pattern that is an anagram of the original siteswap. To find the time-reverse of a siteswap, move each number in the siteswap that number of places to the right (move a 1 one place to the right, or a 2 two places to the right etc.), and then read the resulting sequence backwards. Example: Start with 12345 , and move the numbers to the right to get 31425 (the 3 was moved three places to the right, to the spot just after the 5, which is the position of the 1 in the original pattern, and the 5 moving five places to the right in a period 5 pattern puts it back where it started), then read 31425 backwards to get 52413 . Turning a ladder diagram of a siteswap upside-down turns it into a diagram of the reverse of that pattern.      REVERSE JUGGLING!!! (or is it?)

The throwing hand throws objects across to the catching hand, and the catching hand passes the objects back over to the throwing hand. A shower can be represented in siteswap notation by either an odd number followed by 1 (e.g. 51 , 71 , 91 ), or an even number with an \"x\" followed by a 2x in synchronous notation (e.g. (4x,2x) , (6x,2x) , (8x,2x) ). Either way, the two numbers in the siteswap should add up to twice the number of objects in the pattern.

      "description": "         The contortion (or the contortionist ) is a juggling trick invented by Morris Cronin , where you juggle with one or both arms wrapped around your back. A half contortion is a pattern done with one arm wrapped around the back, and reaching forward between the other arm and the torso. If the right hand is wrapped behind the back, it's still positioned to the right of the left hand, in between the left arm and the left side. All the throws and catches done by that hand are made in this position. In the full contortion , both arms are wrapped around the back and the pattern is still juggled in front. This restricts the movement of the arms so that the throws have to be made accurately using the wrists.   Video : 3 ball full contortion by Luke Burrage    VIdeo : 3 club full contortion by Ameron Rosvall    Video : 4 ball full contortion by Mariia Martin   A body wrap or armpit throw is a front-to-back contortion throw: Instead of reaching across behind your back and sticking your hand between your arm and torso to throw in front, you reach across in front of your body and stick your hand between your arm and torso to throw behind your back , and the object comes forward over the shoulder on the same side as the hand it was thrown from.

      "description": "         A 6-count is a passing pattern where every sixth throw is a pass. Beginning passers usually start passing 6 objects in a 6-count pattern. The same two objects are passed every time they're thrown with the right hands (assuming the pattern is done right-handed). With 8 objects it can be done either entirely in the wimpy pattern , alternating between throwing a right hand pass and a left hand crossing throw, and then two pairs of crossing throws, or the two pairs of synch throws between passes can be non-crossing, so the pattern alternates between two throws of a wimpy pattern with one hand throwing to the other person, and four throws of a synch fountain . The second method is the one that would be used for rings and clubs since those props are not good for wimpy patterns. In a 6-count with an odd number, each person alternates between doing three throws of the basic asynch solo patterns for two different numbers that add up to the number of objects being used in the passing pattern. A 7 ball 6-count alternates between three 4 ball throws and three 3 ball throws, and a 9 ball 6-count alternates between three 5 ball throws and three 4 ball throws. Each time one of the jugglers does a set of three higher throws, the last of the three throws is a pass (a straight pass if it's at an even-number height, e.g. a 4 in a 7 ball pattern, and a diagonal pass if it's at an odd-number height, e.g. a 5 in a 9 ball pattern). To start the pattern, the person holding more objects starts juggling by doing three high throws (the last of which is a pass), and then the other person makes their first throw (also starting with three high throws) at the same time as the first person makes their fourth throw.    6 ball 6-count <3p|3p><3|3><3|3><3|3><3|3><3|3>  7 ball 6-count <R|L><4|3><4|3><4xp|3><3|4><3|4><3|4xp>    8 ball 6-count <(4x,4xp)|(4x,4xp)><(4,4)|(4,4)><(4,4)|(4,4)>  9 ball 6-count <R|L><5|4><5|4><5xp|4><4|5><4|5><4|5xp>   See also Edit  1-count  2-count  3-count  4-count     Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/6-count?oldid=19660 \"     "

All the throws are the same height. The first object should be caught at about the same time that the last object is thrown. A snake pattern is a cascade with as many gaps in it as possible without having any consecutive gaps. It can be used as an exercise to prepare for learning a cascade with nearly twice as many objects as there are in the snake.

      "description": "          This article is about multi-person passing patterns. The term \"feed\" may also refer to handing an object directly from one hand into the other, as you would do in a shower .   A feed is a passing pattern where one juggler (the feeder ) passes with two or more other jugglers (the feedees ), who only pass with the feeder, not with each other. The feedees pass less often than the feeder, because each feedee has to wait their turn while the feeder passes to each of the other feedees. Feeds are typically done with the feedees standing next to each other in a line and facing the feeder. In a basic 3-person feed, the feeder does a 2-count , alternating which feedee to pass to. The feedees both do 4-counts out of time with each other, so they throw to themselves while the other feedee is throwing to the feeder. A 3-person 10 object feed is similar to a 2-person 7 ball 2-count: the passes are 4s and the self throws are 3s. The feedees both throw with the right hand while the feeder is throwing with the left hand and vice versa. Whenever the feeder passes to either feedee, that feedee passes to the feeder on the next beat. A 3-person 11 object feed is similar to a 2-person 7 ball 4-count: the passes are 5s and the self throws are 3s. Whenever the feeder passes to either feedee, the other feedee passes to the feeder at the same time. The most common way to do a feed with more than three people is a sweep feed , where the feeder passes with each feedee along the line from left to right, and then goes back along the line from right to left. A can do a sweep feed with B, C, and D by passing with them in this order: B C D C B C D C... A does a 2-count, C does a 4-count, and B and D do 8-counts . The two jugglers at the ends of the line of feedees in a sweep feed pass less often than the rest of the feedees. In a typewriter feed , all the feedees do the same count. The feeder passes with each feedee along the line, and then jumps back to the other end of the line and continues to go along the line in the same direction. A can do a typewriter feed with B, C, and D by passing with them in this order: B C D B C D B C D... A does a 2-count, and each feedee does a 6-count .     3-person 9 ball 2-count feed <3p2|3p1|3><3|3|3> <3p3|3|3p1><3|3|3>   3-person 9 ball 1-count feed <3p2|3p1|3><3p3|3|3p1>     3-person 10 ball 2-count feed <R|L|L><4xp2|3|3><3|4xp1|3><4xp3|3|3><3|3|4xp1>   3-person 11 ball 2-count feed <5p2|3|5p1><3|3|3> <5p3|5p1|3><3|3|3>     3-person 12 ball 2-count feed <(4x,4xp2)|(4x,4xp1)|(4,4)><(4x,4xp3)|(4,4)|(4x,4xp1)>   3-person 12 ball 1-count feed (two separate 3-handed 6 ball patterns done at the same time) <(4xp3,4xp2)|(4x,4p1)|(4p1,4x)>     4-person 12 ball sweep feed <3p4|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3><3p2|3p1|3|3><3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3>   4-person 12 ball typewriter feed <3p4|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3><3p2|3p1|3|3><3|3|3|3>     5-person 15 ball typewriter feed with the feeder turning in a circle  <3p2|3p1|3|3|3><3|3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3|3><3|3|3|3|3><3p4|3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3|3><3p5|3|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3|3>   12 ball N feed  <3p4|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3><3p3|3p4|3p1|3p2><3|3|3|3>   Feed patterns Edit  Gordon's feed  Parker 4-3 feed  Chuck's 4-3-2 feed  Chuck's Irregular feed  Civil war  Every other every other  Jim's 2-3 feed  Civil war half half  Keith's feed  Reading romp feed  Raccoon   Ogie's nightmare  Random feed  Speed weave   Sunshine patterns  Mesopotamia  JaSoN countdown   Martin's mildness  Martin's madness  Technofeed  Alan's anguish   Rotating feed  Alternating feed  Circle feed   Extended feed  Feast       3 person 16 club world record  16 club  1-count feed by Peter Kaseman , Stefan Brancel , and Sean Carney       SJRI Russian Typewriter  Typewriter feed in a line formation       SJRI Extra-Club Random Feed (3 feedees)  Random feed       SJRI Simul Feed  Simul feed       SJRI 9p Extended Feed  9 person extended feed       SJRI 3-Way Circle Feed  3-way circle feed      Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Feed?oldid=13071 \"     "

You don't have to reach or bend down and throw from an unusually low position, just bring your leg up high enough that you can easily put your hand under it while juggling. The most common way to throw under the leg is throwing under the same leg : if you're using your right hand, you throw under your right leg. You can also throw under the opposite leg (e.g. throwing with the right hand under the left leg). If you squat down or jump, it's possible to throw an object under both legs at the same time. Normally if the right hand throws under either leg, it moves under the leg from right to left, and then throws on the left side of the leg. A more difficult variation is to move your hand under your leg in the opposite direction: move your right hand under either leg from left to right, and throw from the right side of your leg. An under the leg catch is an under the leg throw in reverse : you lift your leg up into the pattern, reach under your leg with an empty hand, and catch an object in this position.

Going into 5 throws of a 5 ball trick from a warm start and back to the basic pattern afterwards would also be called a flash of the trick. Flashing a trick can begin with either a cold start or a warm start, and end with either a collect or a re-entry to the basic pattern or another pattern. The term \"flash\" is also sometimes used for any non- qualifying run where each object is caught at least once. The highest numbers of props that have been flashed are 14 balls by Alex Barron , 13 rings by Albert Lucas , 12 ball bounce by Alan Sulc , and 9 clubs .        14 Ball Flash  14 ball flash by Alex Barron       Anthony Gatto 12 Rings World Record  12 ring flash by Anthony Gatto       9 Club Flash  9 club flash by Ben Thompson     High flash Edit  A \"flash\" can also mean throwing all of the props higher than the basic pattern so that both hands are briefly empty (or throwing all but one or two high and pausing briefly). A high flash can be used as an exercise to prepare for learning to juggle a higher number of objects. Juggle the basic pattern at the same speed you will use for the higher number (possibly slightly faster than the speed you normally use for the number you're juggling now), and keep throwing at the same speed while you do the high flash. If you're preparing for a pattern with two more objects, you should pause for two beats after the flash, before you start throwing again. If the pause is less than two beats long, you need to throw higher or faster. You can clap your hands together while the objects are in the air to make sure your hands are both empty long enough. You can also do other things such as 360s , 720s, or backflips while the objects are in the air after a high flash.      3 ball 2 up flashes Siteswap : 5520     4 ball 2 up flashes Siteswap: 6622       4 ball asynch 3 up flashes Siteswap: 66620     4 ball synch 4 up flashes Siteswap: (6,6)(6,6)(0,0)       5 ball 3 up flashes Siteswap: 77722     5 ball 4 up flashes Siteswap: 777720    See also Edit  Qualify  Run     Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Flash?oldid=20060 \"     "

Catching under the arm is the same thing in reverse : crossing your arms and catching an object in the lower hand. In a windmill , one hand does every throw under the arm and the other hand does outside throws . In a cross-armed pattern , one hand does every throw and every catch under the arm. In Mike's mess , both hands do every throw and every catch under the arm. To do a wrist drop , you start with your arms crossed, drop an object down from the hand on top, uncross your arms and re-cross them the other way, and catch the object under the arm on the same side of the pattern and with the same hand that dropped it.

Each object is thrown at an angle, moving across from one hand to the other, with the hands throwing in an even, alternating rhythm. Each object is thrown to the same height as the previous one, and the pattern with three objects has at any point one or two objects in the air and at least one in the jugglers hands. The pattern may be made higher and/or faster for more objects such as a 5 ball cascade. A cascade is represented in siteswap notation as a single odd number. The highest number of objects that have been qualified (at least twice as many catches as objects) in a cascade is 11 balls (by Alex Barron ), and the highest number of objects that have been flashed (same number of throws and catches as objects) in a cascade is 13 balls (by Alex Barron ). The world record for the longest run of any juggling pattern is 12 hours and 5 minutes of a 3 ball cascade by David Slick .

The \"chop\" is done while holding on to an object after catching it - the object is brought swiftly down through the pattern before moving under the opposite arm to be thrown. A chop can start from a normal catching position, arcing up and then down through the pattern, or you can start the chop by catching an object close to where it peaks, and bring it straight down diagonally through the pattern. The second way is faster and more difficult.

      "description": "         A 1-count is a passing pattern where every throw is a pass. Since this is an ambidextrous pattern, it's more difficult than a 2-count . In passing world records , only the number of passes caught is counted, so numbers passing records are commonly done in 1-count patterns because the easier 2-count would have to be done twice as long to get the same number of caught passes. In a 2-person 1-count with an even number of objects, each person does a pass on every throw while juggling in a cascade or a fountain . This results in two cascades or wimpy patterns each done with one juggler's right hand and the other juggler's left hand. It can be done asynch or synch. In a 6 (or 10, 14, 18) object synch 1-count, the jugglers take turns throwing with both hands at the same time. In an 8 (or 12, 16, 20) object synch 1-count, all four hands throw at the same time. In an 6 object asynch 1-count, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. In an 8 object asynch 1-count, one juggler's right hand throws at the same time as the other juggler's left hand. Collisions can be avoided in an 8 object 1-count by having one person throw passes on the outside of the pattern and the other person throw passes on the inside of the pattern, or by having one person throw at 5-height and the other person throw at 3-height, with the jugglers taking turns throwing with both hands at the same time. A 1-count with an odd number of objects can be done with every throw the same height, and only one hand throwing at a time. One person throws diagonal passes, and the other person throws straight passes. Both people juggle at a normal speed, each throwing in between the other's throws. The order the hands throw in depends on the number of objects being juggled. For a number just above a multiple of 4 (5, 9, 13, 17), the throwing order is: diagonal-passer's right hand, straight-passer's right hand, diagonal-passer's left hand, straight-passer's left hand. For a number just below a multiple of 4 (7, 11, 15, 19), the throwing order is: diagonal-passer's right hand, straight-passer's left hand, diagonal-passer's left hand, straight-passer's right hand. The straight-passer does their first throw (a pass) right after the diagonal-passer's first throw. If the diagonal-passer starts with their right hand, the straight-passer's first pass is with their left hand for 7 objects, or their right hand for 9 objects. A less collision-prone way to do a 1-count with an odd number of objects is to have the diagonal-passer throw higher than the straight-passer. (The two jugglers should throw at the heights of the basic solo patterns for two consecutive numbers that add up to the number of objects being passed, e.g. 3s and 4s for passing 7, or 4s and 5s for passing 9.) In this kind of 1-count, the hands are synchronized: for a number just above a multiple of 4, one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand, and for a number just below a multiple of 4, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. To start the pattern, the diagonal-passer throws one object first, and then the straight-passer makes their first throw at the same time as the diagonal-passer makes their second throw. The 2-height 1-count can also be done with the straight-passer throwing higher than the diagonal-passer. In this kind of 1-count, for a number just above a multiple of 4, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time, and for a number just below a multiple of 4, one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand. To start the pattern, the straight-passer throws one object first, and then the diagonal-passer makes their first throw at the same time as the straight-passer makes their second throw.     5 ball 1-height 1-count <(2,4p)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(2,4xp)><(4p,2)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(4xp,2)>   5 ball 2-height 1-count (diagonal 3s) <R|L><3xp|2xp>   5 ball 2-height 1-count (straight 3s) <3p|2p>     6 ball asynch 1-count <3p|3p>   6 ball synch 1-count <(3p,3p)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3p,3p)!>   6 ball asynch diagonal 1-count <R|L><3xp|3xp>     6 ball synch diagonal 1-count <(3xp,3xp)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3xp,3xp)!>   7 ball 1-height 1-count <(2,8p)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(8xp,2)><(8p,2)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(2,8xp)>   7 ball 2-height 1-count (diagonal 4s) <4p|3p>     7 ball 2-height 1-count (straight 4s) <R|L><4xp|3xp>   8 ball synch 1-count <(4xp,4xp)|(4xp,4xp)>   8 ball asynch 1-count <R|L><4xp|4xp>     8 ball synch 53 1-count <(5p,5p)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3p,3p)!>   8 ball asynch 53 1-count <5p|3p>   9 ball 1-height 1-count <(2,cp)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(2,cxp)><(cp,2)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(cxp,2)>     9 ball 2-height 1-count (diagonal 5s) <R|L><5xp|4xp>   9 ball 2-height 1-count (straight 5s) <5p|4p>   10 ball asynch 1-count <5p|5p>     10 ball synch 1-count <(5p,5p)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(5p,5p)!>   10 ball synch (6x,4x) 1-count <(6xp,6xp)|(4xp,4xp)>   10 ball asynch (6x,4x) 1-count <R|L><6xp|4xp>         16 ball world record (39 catches)!  16 ball 1-count by Peter Kaseman and Doug Sayers    Alternative names Edit  Ultimate passing  Ultimates  See also Edit  2-count  3-count  4-count  6-count     Retrieved from \" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/1-count?oldid=19656 \"     "

In the overhead position, the elbows should stay at least as high as the shoulders, and stick out either forwards or to the sides.

      "description": "         To do an elbow bounce while juggling, skip one throw - the ball that you would have thrown stays in your hand until two beats later. Instead of throwing the ball, use the elbow of that arm to hit the next ball that arrives on that side of the pattern, so that it bounces back up and goes back in the direction of the hand that threw it. If you're juggling more than 3 balls, the throw that goes to your elbow should be a little lower than the rest of the pattern, because it needs to get to your elbow sooner than it would get to your hand if you were just doing the basic pattern . One way to do an elbow bounce is to bounce the ball off of the outside of your elbow, with your arm bent, your hand facing down, and your elbow sticking out to the side. Another way is to bounce it off the inside of your elbow, with your arm held out in front of you - straighten your arm, reaching forward with your hand facing up, so that the inside of your elbow comes up and hits the ball. If you want to continually do elbow bounces, you can hit the ball straight up so you can keep bouncing it on the same elbow, or bounce it back and forth from one elbow to the other, or juggle with one or both hands, with every throw bouncing off of an elbow.

That one object is never thrown high - it just gets passed back and forth at the bottom of the pattern. Alternating showers and patterns containing an object which is thrown only as siteswap 1 or 2, especially 52512, are known as \"baby juggling\" patterns. [1] The object being passed back and forth can be replaced with a fragile object or a baby because it can remain in contact with a hand at all times.

Another 3 ball tennis pattern, called \"real tennis\", is a variation of 423 where the 3s go over the top of the pattern. Burke's barrage is a variation of real tennis where the 4 is thrown under the arm and the 3 is caught under the arm, and then the 2 is carried through the middle of the pattern as the arms uncross. 4 ball tennis doesn't work with a fountain pattern because there are no crossing throws, but it can be done in the wimpy pattern , or in the asynchronous siteswap  53444 . In 5 ball tennis, every fifth throw is an outside throw. \"Fast tennis\" is a 5 ball pattern where every third throw is an outside throw, like in 3 ball tennis. In fast tennis, every ball goes over the top at some point, instead of just one ball going back and forth over the top of the pattern. The umbrella is a trick where certain balls always go over the top like in a tennis pattern, but with synchronous outside throws.
