      "description": "     The Five Ball Cascade is the \n\tbase pattern for five ball juggling. It has the same basic structure as the \n\tthree ball Cascade, with each ball being thrown from one hand to the other \n\tin an arch across the body. For most jugglers, the Five Ball Cascade is one \n\tof the first patterns encountered that can't simply be learned in a day or \n\ttwo. Instead, it requires months and sometimes even years of practice to \n\tbecome proficient.<br/>\n<br/>\n    For this reason, a step-by-step walthrough is not \n\tparticularly helpful. Therefore, this tutorial will instead outline \n\timportant juggling exercises that can be done to accelerate your progress. \n\tThe first exercise to practice is the <strong>\n<a href=\"../4balltricks/552.html\">552</a></strong>.<strong><img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/552.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    </strong>While certainly distinct from the Five Ball Cascade, \n\tsince many throws are made sequentially from the same hand, the 552 is a \n\trelatively slow-paced pattern that uses throws of roughly the same height \n\tand trajectory as the Five Ball Cascade. This is very important, since your \n\tsuccess at mastering that pattern hinges on making accurate throws. Once you \n\thave mastered the 552, it is time to move on to the <strong>\n<a href=\"../4balltricks/5551.html\">5551</a></strong>.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/5551.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The 5551 maintains the same throws as those found in the 552, \n\texcept for the addition of a horizontal pass. This pass is what gives the \n\t5551 more value for learning the Five Ball Cascade, since the throws are \n\tfaster and always alternate hands. Once you become comfortable with the \n\t5551, the final exercise to practice is the <strong>\n<a href=\"../4balltricks/55550.html\">55550</a></strong>.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/55550.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The 55550 is essentially a Five Ball Cascade juggled with \n\tonly four balls. The only real difference between the two patterns is that \n\tthe final throw of the Five Ball Cascade is missing. The 55550 forces you to \n\tpay close attention to the cadence of your throws, since the gap normally \n\tpresent in the pattern can easily disappear with sloppy timing. Upon mastery \n\tof this final exercise, you are ready to add in the fifth ball. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Start with three balls in your dominant hand and two balls in \n\tyour non-dominant. Make a high Cascade throw from your dominant hand, and \n\tfollow it up with two more identical throws, alternating hands each time. At \n\tthis point, three balls should be in the air, and one ball should be in each \n\thand. The first ball that you threw from your dominant hand should now be \n\tapproaching your non-dominant hand. Make a throw from your non-dominant hand \n\tto clear space for the ball to be caught. Similarly, as the first ball you \n\tthrew from your non-dominant hand approaches your dominant hand, make a \n\tthrow from your dominant hand to clear space for that ball to be caught. \n\tThen catch the rest of the balls.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballcascadefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this step extensively. Once you are able to make and \n\tcatch all five throws in a controlled manner, you simply need to keep adding \n\tmore and more throws to the pattern as you become more and more comfortable. \n\tEventually, you will be able to make dozens of throws, at which point it is \n\tsafe to say that you are a five ball juggler. Of course, there is still a \n\tlong road ahead to achieving mastery of the Five Ball Cascade, as you begin \n\tto make hundreds and then even thousands of throws without dropping.</p>"

      "description": "     The Five Ball Split Multiplex \n\tCascade is essentially a three ball Cascade where every normal throw is \n\tpaired with a vertical throw that returns to the same hand. This is the \n\tsplit multiplex, which adds a layer of complexity without making the pattern \n\tthat much harder. As such, the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade is probably \n\tone of the easiest tricks that can be done with five balls.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Five Ball Split Multiplex Cascade, start with \n\ttwo balls in each hand. Make a split multiplex from your dominant hand such \n\tthat one ball travels across your body while the other ball stays roughly in \n\tline with your dominant hand. As the ball thrown across your body approaches \n\tyour non-dominant hand, and as the vertical ball from the multiplex \n\tapproaches your dominant hand, make a second, identical, multiplex from your \n\tnon-dominant hand, clearing space for you to catch that first ball. Then \n\tcatch the rest of the balls.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballsplitmultiplexcascadefour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. While the animations \n\tin this tutorial all show the two balls being thrown at different heights, \n\tthis is a purely stylistic choice, as many jugglers throw both balls at \n\tequal heights. Once you can make these two multiplex throws consistently, it \n\tis time to add in the fifth ball. Start with three balls in your dominant \n\thand and two balls in your non-dominant. Make a single Cascade throw from \n\tyour dominant hand, and then make a split multiplex from your non-dominant \n\thand, clearing space for your hand to catch the first ball. As the ball from \n\tthat multiplex approaches your dominant hand, make a second split multiplex \n\tand catch that ball. Then catch the rest of the balls.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/5balltricks/fiveballsplitmultiplexcascadefive.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have this first cycle mastered, you simply need to \n\tkeep making split multiplexes and you will be running the full Five Ball \n\tSplit Multiplex Cascade.</p>"

However, before catching the small throw made by your \n\tdominant hand (the throw made just before the horizontal pass), you are \n\tgoing to make a high throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your \n\tbody. This throw is a mirror image of the very first throw made by your \n\tnon-dominant hand. You will then catch the small throw with your now empty \n\tdominant hand.

      "description": "     The Four Ball Stacked Box is a \n\tvariation of the Four Ball Box that can best be conceptualized as juggling a \n\tsmall Box underneath a much taller one. This pattern is sometimes referred \n\tto as just the<em> </em>Four Ball Box, but I arbitrarily chose to call \n\t(6,2x)(6,2x)* the Four Ball Box and therefore refer to this trick as the \n\tStacked variation. Terminology issues aside, the Four Ball Stacked Box is a \n\tfairly difficult pattern to learn due to an intense combination of speed and \n\taccuracy. <br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Four Ball Stacked Box, start with one \n\tball in each hand. Make a very high vertical throw from your dominant hand \n\twhile simultaneously making a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to \n\tyour dominant hand. As your dominant hand catches the passed ball you are \n\tgoing to throw that ball vertically at roughly the same height as you would \n\tif juggling the regular three ball Box pattern. This throw and the very high \n\tthrow should ideally peak at the same time. After catching the lower ball in \n\tyour dominant hand you are going to pass it back to your non-dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for your dominant hand to catch the very high ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxttwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides until the timing of all your \n\tthrows is comfortable and consistent. To add in the third ball start with \n\tone ball in your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Make \n\tthe same high vertical throw and horizontal pass combination that you did in \n\tstep one and then make the lower throw underneath it, except this time \n\tyou will also make a simultaneous horizontal pass from your non-dominant \n\thand to your dominant hand. If you were to freeze time you should see all \n\tthree balls on the dominant side of your body—one very high, one lower, and \n\tone in your hand. As the lower throw descends you will pass the ball in your \n\tdominant hand back to your non-dominant hand and then also pass the lower \n\tball back to your non-dominant hand to clear space for your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the very high ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. When you become comfortable \n\tenough with performing one cycle you will then want to combine the cycles on \n\teach side of your body. As you prepare to pass the second ball to your \n\tnon-dominant hand at the end of the cycle you will instead pair that pass with \n\ta very high vertical throw from your non-dominant hand, thereby setting you \n\tup to repeat the cycle on the other side of your body.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxthreecont.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Though the sequence of throws is somewhat different than \n\tthose of the Four Ball Stacked Box, this three ball exercise is still very \n\thelpful. To add in the fourth ball, start with two balls in each hand. Make \n\ta very high vertical throw from your dominant hand and then follow it up \n\twith a lower throw from your dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your \n\tnon-dominant hand. As the lower ball descends you are going to make a very \n\thigh throw from your non-dominant hand and a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand, followed by a lower throw from your non-dominant hand and a \n\tsecond pass from your dominant hand. You will then pass back the ball in \n\tyour non-dominant hand and catch both the very high throw and the lower \n\tthrow in your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballstackedboxfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    And that's pretty much all there is to it. To continue the \n\tpattern simply make another very high vertical throw from your dominant hand \n\talong with the last horizontal pass \n\tand the rest of the throws will fall into place. The Four Ball Stacked Box \n\trequires quick and precise throws, a combination that will likely take you a \n\tfair bit of time to master. </p>"

Theoretically \n\tthere are three different ways in which such a combination could be \n\tperformed, but in practice most jugglers make the \"5\" throw under-the-arm \n\tand then go from there. Unsurprisingly it is recommended that you already be \n\tcomfortable with both the 534 and Four Ball Mills Mess before attempting \n\tthis trick, though also knowing the 531 Mills Mess would probably help as \n\twell.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the 534 Mills Mess, start with two balls in \n\tyour dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant \n\tarm underneath your non-dominant arm, and then make a fairly high \n\tunder-the-arm throw from your dominant hand. Shortly after this throw is \n\tmade (before the ball reaches its peak), throw the ball in your non-dominant \n\thand as a fairly low Cascade throw toward the center of your body. After \n\tthat throw is made you will uncross and then begin to recross your arms. As \n\tyour dominant hand (which is still holding a ball) begins to recross over \n\tyour non-dominant hand the Cascade throw made by your non-dominant hand \n\tshould be descending. Make a medium (shorter than the first throw but higher \n\tthan the second) throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your \n\tbody, clearing space for your hand to catch the Cascade throw as it finishes \n\trecrossing. The high throw, now descending, will be caught under-the-arm by \n\tyour non-dominant hand, followed by the medium throw which will be caught by \n\tyour dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/534millsmessthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

Notice that you now have an extra ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand. Instead of simply waiting to catch the high throw you \n\twill instead make an under-the-arm high throw from your non-dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for it to catch the previous high throw.

Then just repeat the other throws and \n\tcatches performed in the step above, this time using the opposite hand \n\tconfiguration.

Other jugglers began trying to recreate the \n\ttrick, and soon there were several variations of \"Dancey's Devilment\" \n\tfloating about. For this tutorial I have chosen the only variation where I \n\tcould find video documentation.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Dancey's Devilment, start with two balls in \n\tyour non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Cross your \n\tnon-dominant hand underneath your dominant hand, and then make a stacked \n\tunder-the-arm multiplex. The top ball should be thrown roughly twice as high \n\tas the bottom ball, relative to the palm of your hand. As that bottom ball \n\treaches its peak, you are going to swing your dominant hand around and claw \n\tcatch it, uncrossing your arms as you do so. As the top multiplexed ball \n\tdescends, you are going to make a roughly vertical throw from the center of \n\tyour body (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your dominant side). \n\tYou will then catch the top multiplexed ball in your dominant hand and catch \n\tthe other ball with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/danceysdevilmentthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the fourth \n\tball, you are going to start with two balls in each hand. Cross your \n\tdominant hand over your non-dominant, but shift both hands toward the \n\tdominant side of your body. Make a vertical throw from your dominant hand \n\tand then, as the ball begins to descend, make the same stacked under-the-arm \n\tmultiplex done in the previous step from your non-dominant hand. This will \n\tclear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown from your \n\tdominant hand. As the bottom multiplexed ball reaches its peak, you are \n\tgoing to again swing your dominant hand around and claw catch it, uncrossing \n\tyour arms in the process. However, unlike in the previous step, you are \n\tgoing to continue circling your non-dominant hand (which is holding a ball) \n\tup and around as your dominant hand makes its center vertical throw. Your \n\tnon-dominant hand should cross back over your dominant hand just as your \n\tdominant hand is catching the top multiplexed ball. Your non-dominant hand \n\twill then circle underneath the center vertical ball, releasing the ball its \n\tholding and claw catching the center ball (as if juggling Rubenstein's \n\tRevenge). The ball it threw will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/danceysdevilmentfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides. This sequence \n\trepresents one cycle of Dancey's Devilment. To connect both sides of the \n\tpattern, you are simply going to make another stacked under-the-arm \n\tmultiplex, this time with your dominant hand (assuming you made the previous \n\tmultiplex with your non-dominant hand). You will then repeat the cycle on \n\tthe opposite side of your body. Assuming you are already fairly comfortable \n\twith multiplexes and Rubenstein's Revenge, Dancey's Devilment will not be \n\tthat difficult to learn.</span></p>"

      "description": "     The Four Ball Box is, as it \n\tsounds, a four \n\tball version of the Box pattern, which is normally juggled with three balls. \n\tHowever, the Four Ball Box differs from its little brother in two major \n\trespects. Unlike in the regular Box, horizontal passes do not simply \n\talternate direction, but instead occur in pairs, with two balls being tossed \n\tto the same hand sequentially. Similarly, the outside throws do not simply \n\tconsist of one ball thrown vertically, but instead follow a Three in \n\tOne-style trajectory, with two balls in the air at any given time. These \n\tdifferences make the Four Ball Box more complicated than the regular Box, \n\tthough the trick is still relatively easy compared to other four ball \n\tpatterns.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Four Ball Box, it is best to begin with a \n\tsimpler three ball pattern. Start with two balls in your dominant hand and \n\tone ball in your non-dominant. Make two sequential throws from your dominant \n\thand, as if juggling the Three in One. As you are doing the second throw, \n\tmake a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your dominant hand. At \n\tthis point, all three balls should be on the dominant side of your body. As \n\tthe first ball thrown approaches your dominant hand, you are going to pass \n\tback the ball in that hand to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for you \n\tto catch the first ball, after which you will catch the second ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Since these throws form the core of the Four Ball Box, it is \n\timportant that you practice them extensively on both sides. Once your are \n\tproficient on each side, you can chain the two sides together. After you \n\tpass back the third ball to your non-dominant hand (the last throw of the \n\tprevious step), you are going to throw it up in air and repeat the same \n\tthrows done in the previous, except on the opposite side of your body. The \n\thorizontal passes should be made just after each ball from the previous step \n\treturns to your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxthree2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively. To add in the fourth ball, start \n\twith two balls in each hand. Make the same two vertical throws and \n\thorizontal pass that you did in step one,  and then, as the first ball \n\tapproaches your dominant hand, throw the ball in your non-dominant hand \n\tvertically and make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your \n\tnon-dominant hand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first \n\tball. Immediately after the ball is caught, make another vertical throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand while also making a second pass to your non-dominant \n\thand using the ball that your dominant hand just caught. At this point, the \n\tlast vertical ball thrown from your dominant hand should be caught, and \n\tthere should be one ball in your non-dominant hand and two balls in the air \n\tabove it. As the first of those balls in the air descends toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand, make a pass back to your dominant hand and catch that \n\tball. Then catch the second ball that was in the air.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballboxfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. To run the full Four Ball Box, \n\tjust make a vertical throw from your dominant hand as the non-dominant hand \n\tis passing back its ball at the end of the step show above.

The Four Ball \n\tMills Mess is significantly harder to learn the the regular Mills Mess, and \n\tit can take months of practice to achieve a clean and sustainable pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Four Ball Mills Mess, start with two \n\tballs in your dominant hand, and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross \n\tyour dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, and then make a throw from \n\tyour dominant hand in the direction of your non-dominant hand. As you are \n\tmaking that throw, uncross your arms, throwing the ball in your non-dominant \n\thand at the moment when your arms are fully uncrossed. That ball should \n\ttravel in the same direction as the first ball. Once that throw has been \n\tmade, recross your arms, this time with your non-dominant hand on top. <br/>\n<br/>\n    Up to this point, these throws and arm movements are \n\tidentical to the standard Mills Mess. There should be two balls in the air \n\tat this point, and the first ball should be close to your hands now. You \n\twill find yourself naturally wanting to catch the first ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand, which is now on top, since that most closely matches the \n\tthree ball Mills Mess. However, you must overcome that desire and instead \n\tthrow the last ball in your dominant hand under the arm of your dominant \n\thand, clearing space for your dominant hand to catch the first ball. The \n\tsecond ball should be caught by your non-dominant hand, and the third ball \n\tshould be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively on both sides. As you likely \n\tnoticed, the balls don't actually switch hands, despite the arm movements. \n\tThis is an important thing to keep in mind; if you find that the balls are \n\tin fact switching hands, it is a definitive sign that you are doing \n\tsomething wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Once you have the above step mastered, it is time to add in \n\tthe fourth ball. Start with two balls in each hand, and then do the same \n\texact throws done in the previous step. However, when it comes time to catch \n\tthe second throw with your non-dominant hands, there should be, unlike in \n\tthe previous step, a ball in that hand. This ball is going to be thrown over \n\tthe second and third balls, and will travel in the opposite direction. Once \n\tthat ball has been thrown, catch the second ball as you uncross your arms \n\tand then catch the third and fourth balls.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. Once you have it mastered, it is \n\ttime to add in the fifth throw. Notice in the previous step that when the \n\tthird ball is caught, there is already a ball in that hand. For the next \n\tstep, your are going to make a throw from that hand in the same direction as \n\tthe fourth throw, and recross your hands, catching the fourth throw in your \n\tbottom hand and the fifth throw in your top hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmessfive.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown in the animation, practice this on both sides. Now \n\tat this point, you may be able to figure out the rest of the pattern your \n\tself based on the rhythm of this step. However, if you are still confused, \n\tthere is one more individual throw to practice. The sixth throw is made to \n\tclear space for the fourth throw to be caught, and it is a full under the \n\tarm throw, going the same direction as the previous two throws.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fourballmillsmesssix.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Again, practice this on both sides. By this point, it would \n\tbe very surprising if your body didn't naturally pick up the rhythm of the \n\tpattern. However, just in case, the seventh throw is made from your top \n\thand, and signals the point where the pattern once again changes directions. \n\tAfter the seventh throw is made, your arms uncross as they make the eighth \n\tand ninth throws.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Running the full Four Ball Mills Mess for extended periods \n\ttakes a lot of practice, and is almost, but not quite as difficult as the \n\tFive Ball Cascade. And remember, the balls never switch hands, so always \n\twatch out for that as you practice.  </p>"

The \n\tanimation I found for Cliff's Confusion shows the pattern juggled in a \n\tslightly asymmetric fashion, with the multiplexes on one side of the body \n\tbeing thrown more vertically. I couldn't figure out if this was the proper \n\tform or simply an unconscious discrepancy, so I decided to focus on a \n\tsymmetric version (the original animation can be found by following the link \n\tin the \"Other Tutorials\" box). Regardless, it is easy to transition between \n\tthe two forms, so learning one variation will not hamper your mastery of the \n\tother.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Cliff's Confusion, start with two balls in each \n\thand. Cross your dominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then \n\tmake a vertical under-the-arm throw from your dominant hand. As that ball \n\treaches its peak, make a stacked multiplex throw from your non-dominant hand \n\ttoward the center for your body, clearing space for you to catch the first \n\tball with your non-dominant hand. As that ball is being caught, uncross your \n\tarms and then recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, \n\tcatching the bottom ball from the multiplex. The top ball will then be \n\tcaught by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/cliffsconfusionfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To connect the cycles, \n\tyou are going to add a third throw, made from your non-dominant hand, right \n\tas that hand is catching the top ball of the multiplex. This vertical throw \n\tsets you up for another multiplex, as shown in the animation below.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/cliffsconfusionfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have mastered this third throw, you simply need to \n\tkeep repeating the same multiplex/vertical throw pair that you practiced in \n\tstep one, and you will be juggling Cliff's Confusion.</p>"

The trick itself is simply a pair of Two-in-ones being juggled \n\tasynchronously (this pattern is technically called the Asynchronous \n\tFountain). Unlike many three ball tricks, the Fountain is generally not a \n\tpattern that can be simply \"figured out,\" and instead often requires a few \n\tweeks of practice to get mastered. Before you start learning the trick, it \n\tis important for you to be able to juggle a Two-in-One with each hand, and \n\tit helps to know the Half-Box (441).<br/>\n<br/>\n    The first step in juggling the Fountain is to practice with \n\tthree balls. Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and one in your \n\tother. Throw one ball from your dominant hand as if in a Two-in-one, and the \n\ttoss the ball in your other hand in a similar fashion. Once the first ball \n\thas almost returned to your dominant hand, throw the last ball up in the \n\tair, and then catch them all.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fountainthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this step extensively with both your dominant and \n\tnon-dominant hand leading. Remember, you will need to be able to maintain a \n\tTwo-in-one in each hand, so always practice with both hands equally. The \n\tnext step to learning the Fountain is a  four ball version of the step \n\tabove, with each ball being thrown once. Start with two balls in each hand. \n\tThen, throw one ball from your dominant hand, followed by one from your \n\tnon-dominant hand, followed by the other from your dominant hand, followed \n\tby the other ball in your non-dominant hand. Catch all the balls after these \n\tfour throws.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/fountainfour.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this extensively. Make sure to do this \n\texerice starting with each hand. After you can do this step cleanly and \n\tconsistently, it is only a matter of increasing the number of throws, and \n\tyou will be juggling the Fountain. I would recommend adding just one or two \n\tthrows at a time for the first few cycles, then increasing the rate as you \n\tbecome more proficient. The Fountain is the backbone of many more advanced \n\tfour ball tricks, so it would be wise to invest a lot of time into mastering \n\tthis pattern.</p>"

Start with two \n\tballs in each hand, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your \n\tnon-dominant hand (you could cross them in the opposite configuration if you \n\twanted, but you will need to reverse the dominant and non-dominant hands \n\twhenever an instruction is given). Make a fairly vertical throw from your \n\tdominant hand, and then throw a stacked multiplex from your non-dominant \n\thand while simultaneously uncrossing your arms.

You will then make \n\tan under-the-arm stacked multiplex from your non-dominant hand, clearing \n\tspace for the ball just thrown from your dominant hand to be caught. You \n\twill then catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your non-dominant hand, and \n\tthen reach over and grab the top multiplexed ball with your dominant hand \n\t(just as you did for the previous cycle).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltztwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Again, practice these throws until you can do them \n\tconsistently.

You will then catch the top multiplexed ball with \n\tyour empty dominant hand, which should be uncrossing. As the ball just \n\tthrown from your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you will \n\tmake a stacked multiplex from your non-dominant hand, clearing space for the \n\tball to be caught. You will catch the bottom multiplexed ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand, and then cross your dominant hand underneath your \n\tnon-dominant to catch the top multiplexed ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/4balltricks/tennesseewaltzthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice all three of the cycles extensively. To begin a new \n\tset of cycles, you simply need to make an under-the-arm throw from your \n\tdominant hand before it catches the top multiplexed ball from the third \n\tcycle. This will set you up to make a multiplex from your non-dominant hand \n\tidentical to the one thrown in the first cycle.

      "description": "     The Six Ball Fountain is, as it \n\tsounds, the six ball version of the Fountain. It is the base pattern of six \n\tball juggling, and therefore an important milestone in one's juggling \n\tcareer. Like the Five Ball Cascade, the Six Ball Fountain is very difficult \n\tand time consuming to learn, and only with dedicated practice can it be \n\tmastered. Given that one does not simply learn the Six Ball Fountain in a \n\tday, and seeing as how the pattern is in fact quite simple in principle, \n\tthis tutorial will only be able to offer basic advice to help you along.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Before attempting the Six Ball Fountain it is very important \n\tthat you already be fairly comfortable with the Three in One using <strong>\n\tboth</strong> hands. While outright mastery isn't really necessary, you \n\tshould at least be able to perform runs of 15-20 catches with good \n\tconsistency.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/threeinone.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    When you first start practicing the Six Ball Fountain it is \n\tmost helpful to begin with a flash, which means you will throw and catch \n\teach ball once. It is important that you take time to really focus on this \n\tstep as it will provide you with a solid foundation for when you try to add \n\tmore throws. When performing the flash make sure that the balls are staying \n\ton their respective sides and not crossing through the center, and that the \n\ttiming feels roughly balanced (it's okay if it isn't perfect).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/6balltricks/sixballfountainsix.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you are comfortable with the flash you can begin to add \n\tin more throws. Now this is where different juggling paradigms come into \n\tconflict a bit. Some jugglers argue that you should engage in highly \n\tstructured practice, adding in only one or two throws at a time then \n\tpurposefully stopping. Others say that you should just try to juggle the \n\tpattern for as long as possible, only stopping when you drop a ball. Both of \n\tthese approaches have some merit, so I personally recommend a compromise \n\tmethod. You should not stop juggling based on a particular number of throws, \n\tbut instead stop when the pattern becomes unstable. For the Six Ball \n\tFountain this usually means when throws from different hands begin crossing \n\tover each other. Not only does this allow you more flexibility but it also \n\tallows you to practice collecting all six balls at the end of a run.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Unfortunately there isn't much more to say. The Six Ball \n\tFountain is not a very hard pattern to figure out, but it can be grueling to \n\tlearn. Progress will likely be slower than for the Five Ball Cascade, but \n\tnot extremely so—just try to remember that the world of six ball juggling \n\tis waiting for you.</p>"

      "description": "\n     \nThe Takearound is an asymmetric variation of the Takeouts pattern (one the most popular 423 mess patterns) in which each hand\nhandles the siteswap 2 differently. One hand performs a normal takeout carry around the pattern, while the other hand, in lieu of a\ntakeout, has the considerably more difficult task of a dropped active 2 while crossed over on the other side of the juggler's body,\nand while also contending with the path of the other arm.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n    \nIn this pattern each ball plays a unique role (so it may be helpful to learn it with three differently colored balls).\nThe focal point and inspiration of the pattern name is the takearound 4/2 ball, which is only touched by the dominant hand. Its path is\na vertical 4 on the opposite side of the body, caught close to its peak, and then a swooping 2 up and around the pattern, ending up at the\npoint where it started for the next 4 throw. The other 4/2 ball, touched only by the other hand, stays in a vertical column on the\nopposite side of the body. The 4 throw for this ball is essentially the same as for the takearound \n\tball, although it is caught a little lower. The first part of the 2 is a slight carry upward, \n\tafter which the ball is dropped and subsequently caught by the same hand. It is\nthen quickly thrown back up as the next 4. Meanwhile, the siteswap 3 ball is thrown vertically \n\talong the center of the pattern and the\njuggler's torso, alternating hands with each catch Unlike the other two balls, it does not have a particularly interesting life story.<br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/takearoundtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n     \nTo start learning this pattern, study the simple two ball exercise above. Disregarding the siteswap 3 ball for the moment, work on the\nmechanics and timing of the two 4/2 balls. Once you feel comfortable with this, you can add in the third ball.<br/>\n<br/>\n    \n\tStart with two balls in your dominant \n\thand and the third\nball in your non-dominant hand. First, throw the takearound ball straight up \n\twith your dominant hand from a crossed position\nunderneath the opposite arm. The second ball is then dropped from your non-dominant hand, \n\tafter which you will whip that same hand around to catch it and end up\nwith your dominant arm crossed over your non-dominant arm. As you catch the dropped ball with your non-dominant hand, your dominant hand \n\twill throw the third ball up in a central column and then reach up to catch \n\tthe first ball. The second ball is then thrown up vertically by your \n\tnon-dominant hand, allowing it to catch the third ball, while your dominant \n\thand carries the first ball around the pattern. To reset, pass the third\nball into your dominant hand as it reaches the end of its arc, and catch the second ball in your non-dominant hand, crossing over your dominant\narm.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/takearoundthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    \nAdding more cycles of the pattern should be relatively straightforward once you have mastered the previous exercises.\nThe continuous Takearound pattern is relatively challenging, but quite fun to juggle.<br>\n<br/>\n<strong>Tutorial created and submitted by Andrew Olson. </strong>\n</br></p>"

The only \n\tdifference is that instead of making the horizontal pass underneath the \n\tpattern, the Shuffle makes the pass through it (Slam throw). Knowing this, \n\tit would be best to start out by learning Slams. Start with one ball in each \n\thand. From your non-dominant hand, you are going to throw one ball across \n\tyour body. Then bring your dominant hand down on top of it, throwing the \n\tball currently in that hand downward to your non-dominant hand, and catching \n\tthe first ball:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/shufflefirststep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tPractice this a lot!

Gradually—and I do emphasize the word gradually—you \n\twill start being able to run the Shuffle longer and longer.

      "description": "     Olas is a rare but impressive \n\ttrick established by <span><a href=\"http://www.olalofberg.se/aqua/fintro.html\">\n\tOla Löfberg</a></span> that utilizes a unique revolving catch along with \n\tquick multiplexes to create one of the most unique juggling patterns. Unfortunately, \n\tdue to its lack of mention in most juggling guides, Olas is a trick known to \n\trelatively few jugglers, particularly when compared to patterns like the Mills \n\tMess and Rubenstein's Revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Olas, it is best to break the trick down into two \n\tbasic components, the catch and the multiplex. The odd revolving catch of \n\tOlas is best learned by starting with two balls in your non-dominant hand. \n\tThrow one into the air, as if in a Cascade pattern, and then claw catch it \n\twith your dominant hand. Right as that catch is made, throw the the second \n\tball, and swing you dominant hand back around and claw catch that ball as \n\twell.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olastwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n        Practice this catch until it is \n\tsecond nature with both hands. The second part of Olas is the multiplex \n\tthrow, which may take some practice to master. If you aren't already \n\tfamiliar with a multiplex throw, it is a throw in which you release two \n\tballs simultaneously. In this case, one ball will be passed straight into \n\tthe other hand, while the second ball will be thrown to the other side as if \n\tin a normal Cascade. Before any of this happens, you will also be making a \n\tnormal cascade throw with a ball in the other hand, which will travel over \n\tthe two multiplexed balls.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasmulti.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Again, practice this portion until you can perform it \n\tsmoothly and consistently. Now that you have learned both components, it is \n\ttime to put them together. Start by juggling a regular Cascade (this is the \n\teasiest way to transition into Olas), and then make a claw catch on one of \n\tthe balls using your dominant and then do a revolving catch of the next \n\tball. You should now have two balls in you dominant hand, and one ball in \n\tthe other. Throw that ball out of your non-dominant hand as if in a Cascade, \n\tand then perform a multiplex with the two balls in your dominant hand, just \n\tlike in the animation above. Resume a normal Cascade afterward.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasrun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have mastered this pattern on both sides (as shown \n\tin the animation), it is only a matter of removing the extra Cascade throws \n\tin the middle, and you are juggling Olas. Instead of returning to a Cascade \n\tafter the multiplex, you are instead going to toss the passed ball back \n\tacross your body, and then claw catch the more lofty multiplex throw. Using \n\ta revolving catch, you are going to then grab the ball thrown from your \n\tother hand, and then multiplex again out of that end, repeating the pattern \n\ton the other side of your body. If you are having a hard time visualizing \n\tthe continuation, watch the animation below closely, \n\tpaying particular attention to what happens after the multiplex throw (the \n\tballs are colored for added clarity).<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/olasslow.gif\" width=\"400\"/>  </p>"

The throwing rhythm is right-pause-right-left-pause-left... with a 1-beat pause between throws with the same hand.  Two balls are thrown with non-crossing throws like the throws in a 4 ball fountain (4s), one staying on each side of the pattern, and the other ball is thrown across from hand to hand (3s), about half the height of the non-crossing throws. The 2 is a pause between a 4 and a 3 with the same hand, where the other hand is just holding a ball and not throwing.

These changes give King of Hearts a more fluid feel, and \n\tmake it generally easier to juggle, especially if you are already familiar \n\twith similar patterns such as Orka's Mess. It is not necessary to know the \n\tKingston Shuffle before attempting this trick, but it will help. This \n\ttutorial however will assume you cannot already perform the pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn King of Hearts, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a normal Cascade throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand, and then bring your dominant hand over to the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body and perform a stacked multiplex. With your \n\tdominant hand now empty, catch the first ball, then bring your hand back \n\ttoward the center of your body and make a mostly vertical throw angled \n\ttoward your non-dominant hand. Catch the top multiplex ball as it's falling \n\tback down with your now empty dominant hand, then swing that hand over and \n\taround the ball it just threw while catching the bottom multiplex ball with \n\tyour non-dominant hand.

You will \n\tthen catch the bottom multiplex ball with your non-dominant hand, while \n\tbringing your dominant hand to the center of your body. As you make a \n\trelatively vertical throw toward your non-dominant hand from your dominant \n\thand, you are going to raise your non-dominant hand up with the ball, such \n\tthat the distance between the thrown ball and your hand stays the same. As \n\tyou catch the Column ball thrown earlier with your dominant hand, and as the \n\tvertical ball beneath your non-dominant hand reaches its peak, you are going \n\tto bring your non-dominant hand downward and catch the ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/kingofheartsfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

As such, the Boston Shuffle can \n\tserve as practice for the Shuffle, but can also be learned more quickly if \n\tyou already know the Shuffle beforehand.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To start learning the Boston Shuffle, you first need to be \n\table to do slam throws on each side. Hold one ball in each hand, and then \n\tmake a Cascade throw with your non-dominant hand. Then, raise your dominant \n\thand up over the thrown ball, and make a downward pass with the held ball, \n\tcatching it in your non-dominant hand, and then claw catch the first ball \n\twith your dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshuffletwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this slam throw on both sides until your are very \n\tcomfortable with it. To add in the third ball, start by juggling a normal \n\tCascade pattern. Then, make a slam throw with your dominant hand, throwing \n\tthe ball in your non-dominant hand as an overthrow to clear space for the \n\tdownward pass. After the pass is caught, resume juggling the Cascade.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshufflethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides until you can perform it smoothly \n\tand without major hesitation. The final step to learning the Boston Shuffle is \n\tto chain one slam together with a slam from the opposite side. Start by \n\tjuggling a normal Cascade, then make a slam throw and overthrow like in the \n\tprevious step. However, instead of going back into the Cascade, you are \n\tgoing to immediately make a single Cascade throw using the hand which had \n\tjust done a slam, and then perform another slam using your other hand. After \n\tthe last slam, return to the normal Cascade.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonshufflerun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once you have mastered two slams, try a third, fourth, fifth, \n\tand so on until you are running the Boston Shuffle continuously. This pattern \n\tis not particularly complicated, but the accuracy required for the slam \n\tthrows will take some time to acquire. If performed correctly, each ball \n\tshould travel along a single path (e.g. only one ball should ever be \n\tslammed), so it may help to use easily distinguishable balls when \n\tpracticing.</p>"

The other hand contributes \n\tvery little to the trick, only making a quick pass during the shuffle. <br/>\n<br/>\n    The first step to learning the Truffle Shuffle is to practice \n\tthe shuffle pass. Start with one ball in each hand, and then lift your \n\tdominant hand about twelve inches above your non-dominant hand. Then, your \n\tare going to make simultaneous throws from each hand. The dominant hand will \n\tthrow diagonally downward toward your non-dominant hand, while your \n\tnon-dominant hand will make a roughly horizontal throw (it should be angled \n\tslightly upward toward your dominant hand).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/truffleshuffletwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice these two throws until they are second nature.

Cross your dominant hand underneath your \n\tnon-dominant hand, and then make a high under-the-arm throw back towards the \n\tcenter of your body. Then, bring your dominant hand back to its normal side, \n\traise it up diagonally above your non-dominant hand, and do the two throws \n\tpracticed in the previous step.

Instead \n\tof making a fake toss with one of your hands (as done in the original \n\tGeorgian Shuffle), you make an actual throw, under which you perform the \n\tmultiplex. Beyond that, the two Georgian Shuffles are pretty similar, except \n\tthe inside multiplexed ball is grabbed by the hand that didn't throw it \n\t(i.e. the hand that made the first throw) in the symmetrical variation.\n\t<br/>\n<br/>\n    Before attempting the Symmetric Georgian Shuffle, it is \n\timportant that you already be able to juggle the normal Georgian Shuffle on \n\tboth sides of your body (i.e. you are able to juggle the pattern with either \n\thand making the multiplex). To begin learning the Symmetric Georgian \n\tShuffle, start with two balls in your dominant hand and one ball in your \n\tnon-dominant. Make a normal Cascade-style throw from your non-dominant hand, \n\tand then cross your dominant hand to the non-dominant side of your body \n\t(your non-dominant hand can either be brought to the outside or up against \n\tyour chest to move it out of the way). Make a split-multiplex throw from \n\tyour dominant hand, and then catch the Cascade throw with your now empty \n\tdominant hand. As the multiplexed balls reach their peak, pluck the inside \n\tball out of the air using your non-dominant hand, and then cross your \n\tdominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand to catch the outside ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianshufflethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. To add in the final throw, run \n\tthrough the same throws and catches made in the previous step, but add in an \n\tunder-the-arm vertical throw along the outside of the outer multiplexed ball \n\tusing your dominant hand, which will then catch the multiplexed ball. As \n\tthat outside vertical throw begins to descend, take your non-dominant hand, \n\twhich should have just grabbed the inside multiplexed ball, and swing it \n\tover and around the outside ball, catching it as the ball descends.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/symgeorgianshufflefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this step on both sides. You have just \n\tcompleted one cycle of the Symmetric Georgian Shuffle. To run the full \n\tpattern, simply make another Cascade-style throw (with your opposite hand \n\tthis time) slightly before the outside vertical throw is caught by your \n\tother hand. This will set you up to make another multiplex throw, after \n\twhich the cycle simply continues. </p>"

Before attempting Relf's Revenge it is important that you \n\talready be fairly comfortable with Rubenstein's Revenge, but no experience \n\twith Relf's Revenge is necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\n     To begin learning Relf's Revenge 6, start with one ball \n\tin your dominant hand and two balls in your non-dominant hand. Raise your \n\tdominant hand up to about shoulder height, and then shift both of your hands \n\tto the center of your body such that your non-dominant hand is positioned \n\tunder your dominant hand. Make a roughly vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand (ideally it should be angled slightly toward your \n\tnon-dominant side) while simultaneously swinging your dominant hand under \n\tand around the thrown ball. As the ball peaks, your dominant hand should be \n\tcircling over it; you will then throw the ball in your dominant hand over \n\ttoward the non-dominant side of your body and claw-catch the first ball. So \n\tfar this should all feel pretty similar to Rubenstein's Revenge. After the \n\tclaw-catch you will then swing your dominant hand in a \"C\" shape toward the \n\tdominant side of your body while making a throw from your non-dominant \n\thand—the throw will be made from the center of your body toward your \n\tdominant side, but it should be mostly vertical. This will clear space for \n\tyour non-dominant hand to catch the ball thrown by your dominant hand. Your \n\tdominant hand will then, after completing its \"C\"-shaped flourish, catch the \n\tball thrown from your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevenge6three.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Instead of simply letting the ball descend into your \n\tnon-dominant hand, you are going to reach up and claw-catch it. You will \n\tthen continue the downward motion of the claw-catch while simultaneously \n\tmaking a throw from your dominant hand that mirrors the very first throw you \n\tmade; this will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the ball your \n\tnon-dominant hand had thrown (the last throw of the previous step). You will \n\tthen swing your non-dominant hand around and under the ball just thrown by \n\tyour dominant hand before finally claw-catching it. You should end up with \n\ttwo balls in your non-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevenge6full.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

Then make a fairly \n\thigh throw from your dominant hand along the center of your body while basically dropping the ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand (you should still give the ball a bit of upward movement). In \n\tthe same motion you are going to uncross and then recross your arms such \n\tthat your dominant hand is on top, catching the \"dropped\" ball with your \n\tdominant hand as it recrosses.

If done \n\tcorrectly, this ball should be caught before the other ball reaches its \n\tpeak.

To add in the next \n\tthrow, you are going to again start with one ball in each hand, and then \n\tperform the same vertical throws and catches you did in previous step. This \n\ttime however, you are also going to throw the ball you caught in the air \n\tover to the other side of your body.

Make the same throws and catches as in \n\tthe previous step, but this time make a vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand before using it to catch the ball in the air (this happens \n\tafter your dominant hand catches and then throws that same ball). As a \n\tgeneral rule, all vertical throws made in this pattern should be the same \n\theight.

However, \n\tto connect the various cycles, you will also need perform a normal \n\thorizontal pass/vertical throw combination. To add this in, you are going to \n\trepeat the process from the previous step, and then, as the ball that has \n\tbeen in the air the entire time begins to finally descend toward your \n\tdominant hand, you will make a vertical throw from your dominant hand. This \n\twill clear space for that hand to catch the other ball. As the ball just \n\tthrown begins to descend, you are going to make a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand and a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (this throw \n\tshould be made close to the center of your body).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/trueboxfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    The animation above demonstrates one full cycle of the True \n\tBox.

For the final step, you are going to start with \n\tthree balls—two in your dominant hand, one in your non-dominant. You are \n\tgoing to make one overthrow from your dominant hand, then make a second one \n\tusing the other ball from that hand. Just as that second ball is leaving, \n\tyou are going to make a pass using the third ball in your non-dominant hand. \n\tIf you timed it right, the first ball should land in your non-dominant right \n\tafter you make the pass, thus allowing you to keep repeating the cycle:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/showerfinalstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tAnd there you have it.

After you have \n\tthe Shower pattern solid, you can reverse directions and make overthrows \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand. I would highly recommend doing this, because it \n\thelps prepare both your hands for making consistent horizontal passes, which will occur in \n\tpatterns like the Box. You can also add more balls into the pattern (four \n\tand five ball Showers are quite common), the only difference is that your \n\tthrows must be higher and faster.</p>"

The Cascade is generally considered to be the easiest pattern, and \n\tforms the backbone of many other tricks. <br/>\n<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"178\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/oneball_50000.gif\" style=\"float: right\" width=\"192\"/>    To begin learning the pattern, it is important to make sure you are \n\tcomfortable with throwing and catching a ball. It sounds silly, I know, but \n\twhen first starting to juggle I found that my left hand (non-dominant) had a \n\thard time accurately throwing the ball to my right. You will want to get \n\tvery comfortable throwing the ball from you dominant hand to your \n\tnon-dominant, and vice versa. Try to keep the height of the throws a little \n\tbit above your head. Once you have mastered this, you are ready to move on \n\tto the next step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tIt is at this second step that most jugglers begin dropping (short hand way \n\tto say that you have failed to catch your ball) a lot. As such, this is \n\tprobably a good time to remind you that using tennis balls on a hard floor \n\tis not the best way to juggle. For beginners, I would highly recommend \n\tgetting some good quality bean bags\n\t<a href=\"http://www.dube.com/beanbag/4-panel-juggling-beanbags.php\">such as \n\tthese ones from Dube</a>. They are soft, don't bounce or roll (much), and \n\tare quite easy to catch.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t    Now that you have the proper juggling equipment, it is \n\ttime to add in the second ball. This second ball is going to travel through \n\tthe air with a similar trajectory as the first ball, except it is going to \n\tbe thrown underneath that first ball, and travel in a different direction.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"168\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/twoballcascade.gif\" width=\"168\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tTo start, hold a ball in each hand, and then throw one ball up in the same \n\ttrajectory as step one. As that ball reaches it peak, you are going to throw \n\tthe second ball up underneath it towards your other hand (the one that threw \n\tthe first ball), then catch them both. You are going to want to make sure \n\tthat you practice throwing the first ball from both hands. If that description confuses you, \n\tjust focus on the animation above and try to copy its throws. This pattern \n\tis known as the Two Ball Cascade.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t    You \n\tmust make sure not to pass the second ball horizontally to your other hand \n\t(shown below), \n\tas this is the way people often intuitively try and juggle two balls.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle3\" height=\"136\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/incorrect.gif\" width=\"156\"/><br/>\n\t    Once you are able to juggle two balls correctly without \n\tmuch trouble, you are ready to add in the third ball. The first pattern to \n\tlearn with three balls is the flash, where every ball is thrown up and then \n\tcaught again like so.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle4\" height=\"168\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/3ballflash.gif\" width=\"167\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tThe flash is very similar to the Two Ball Cascade, except you sneak in a \n\tthird toss during the pause that occurs after you throw the first two balls. \n\tWhile the timing of this trick is slightly different than the standard Three \n\tBall Cascade (notice there is still a period of time where all three balls \n\tare in the air), practicing the flash will improve your accuracy and throw \n\tspeed. Once you can do the Three Ball Flash reliably without too many drops, \n\tyou are ready to move onto the final step.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t    For the final step in learning the Three Ball Cascade, \n\tyou will be combining all the skills learned thus far. Starting with three \n\tballs (two in your dominant hand), you are going two throw your first ball, \n\tand wait for it to reach its peak. Then you will throw the ball in your \n\tnon-dominant hand, allowing for the first ball to land in your now empty \n\thand. Once that second ball reaches its peak, you will throw the third ball \n\tfrom your dominant hand, clearing room for the second ball to be caught. And \n\tso the cycle continues, each time a ball reaches its peak, another one is \n\tthrown, freeing up a hand to catch the first ball. The animation below shows \n\tthe pattern being run for five throws and catches.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle5\" height=\"167\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/runoffive.gif\" width=\"166\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tNow that you have the basic pattern down, the only thing you have left to do \n\tis practice, practice, practice! When it comes down to it, that's all \n\tjuggling is. No one is born good at juggling, the experts work hard for the \n\ttalent they posses, and anybody can become as good with enough dedication \n\tand work. After practicing the Three Ball Cascade, you should see your \n\tthrows becoming more accurate, your arm movements less noticeable, and the \n\theight required for you to run the pattern will decrease.<br/>\n</span></p>"

You will then make a second throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand, this time a crossing throw toward the dominant side \n\tof your body, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the first \n\tball it threw. Your dominant hand, having just finished its circle, will \n\tthen shift horizontally over to the non-dominant side of your body such that \n\tit arrives right as the crossing throw peaks. You will then bring the hand \n\tback down to catch the crossing throw.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsfactorythree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

You will then use your now empty dominant hand to snatch \n\tthe crossing ball (thrown by your non-dominant hand) as it peaks and begins \n\tto descend. This is essentially identical to what occurs in the regular \n\tFactory. As your dominant hand is snatching its ball you will simultaneously \n\tmake a second crossing throw, roughly identical to the first, from your \n\tnon-dominant hand. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch \n\tthe ball that your dominant hand just dropped.

      "description": "     The Crossed-Arm Shower is, as \n\tits name suggests, a variation of the Shower pattern in which your arms are \n\tcrossed. The overall shape of the pattern is virtually unchanged (though \n\tusually smaller), so conceptually the trick is fairly simple. The main \n\tdifficulty comes from learning how to make horizontal passes from a \n\tcrossed-arm position—a very unusual throw type not present in most juggling \n\ttricks. The hand that throws these passes can be crossed over or \n\tunder, but for this tutorial I am going to consider the crossed-over form as \n\tstandard, and the crossed-under form as the \"Reverse Variation.\"<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Crossed-Arm Shower, start with one ball \n\tin your dominant hand and then cross your arms such that your dominant arm \n\tis on top. Without uncrossing your arms, make a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand to your non-dominant hand. You will want to make this a \n\tforceful throw along a straight line—the ball should not be lightly tossed, \n\tas might be your first instinct.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowerone.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until the throw feels natural. Unlike in the \n\tanimation, you could also practice passing the ball back from the hand \n\tcrossed under, as it is the quickest way to return the ball to your dominant \n\thand. To add in the second ball, you are going to start with one ball in \n\teach hand and your arms crossed in the same configuration as before. You \n\twill then perform an under-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand toward \n\tyour dominant hand while simultaneously making a horizontal pass from your \n\tdominant hand to your non-dominant hand (as was practiced in the first \n\tstep), catching the under-the-arm throw with your now empty dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowertwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively. Next, we are going to extend the \n\tsecond step such that, after making its first under-the-arm throw, your \n\tnon-dominant hand will make another throw using the ball passed by your \n\tdominant hand. Your dominant hand will then catch the first under-the-arm \n\tthrow and quickly pass it back to your non-dominant hand, clearing space for \n\tyour dominant hand to catch the second throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowertworun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can do all of the throws comfortably \n\tand consistently. To add in the third ball, start with two balls in your \n\tnon-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant hand. Cross your arms in the \n\tsame configuration as before, then make an under-the-arm throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand. As that ball peaks and begins to descend, you will \n\tmake a second throw from your non-dominant hand while simultaneously passing \n\tthe ball in your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand. This will clear \n\tspace for your dominant hand to catch the first under-the-arm throw. Your \n\tdominant hand will then also catch the second ball thrown from your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/crossedarmshowerthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As always, practice this step until you are comfortable with \n\tit. To continue the pattern, simply make another pass/under-the-arm-throw \n\tcombination and then keep adding them in as you become more proficient. The \n\tCrossed-Arm Shower is an enjoyable pattern in its own right, but its real \n\tvalue lies in unlocking three ball tricks that utilize a crossed-arm \n\thorizontal pass (e.g. non-standard versions of the 441 and 531 Mills Mess). </p>"

This flourish should be practically identical to the one \n\tperformed in Rubenstein's Revenge. Once your dominant hand has circled down \n\tto the center of your body, you are going to make a roughly vertical throw. \n\tIf timed correctly, your dominant hand should then be free to catch the \n\tthird ball.

Instead of simply crossing your dominant hand and \n\tcatching the ball as it descends, you are going to make a throw from your \n\tdominant hand on the dominant side of your body toward the center of your \n\tbody, and then cross your dominant hand over and claw catch the other ball \n\tout of the air (the ball you simply let fall into your dominant hand at the \n\tend of the previous step). As the ball thrown from your dominant hand travels \n\ttoward the center of your body, you are going to make a throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand underneath that ball, toward the dominant side of your \n\tbody. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball \n\tthrown from your dominant hand. You will then also catch the ball thrown \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflenext.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Notice in the animation above that one of the hands (your \n\tdominant hand) stays stuck awkwardly in the air after it claw catches one of \n\tthe balls. For the final step, your are going to swing that ball over the \n\ttop of the pattern as your non-dominant hand is making its throw (the last \n\tthrow of the previous step). As that ball thrown from your non-dominant hand \n\tdescends, you are going to make another throw from your non-dominant toward \n\tthe center of your body (biased a bit toward the dominant side of your \n\tbody). This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball it \n\tthrew previously. By this point your dominant hand should have finished \n\tits arc around the pattern, where it will end up crossed under your \n\tnon-dominant hand (back where it started). You will then use it to catch the \n\tball just thrown from your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/icelandicshufflefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    You have just completed one full cycle of the Icelandic \n\tShuffle. To continue the pattern, simply make an underarm throw from your \n\tdominant hand after it crosses underneath your non-dominant hand. This will \n\tclear space for the hand to catch the final ball from the last cycle and \n\talso \n\tcreate the first throw of the new cycle. The Icelandic Shuffle is a \n\tfast-paced, compact pattern that will take a lot of practice to fully \n\tcontrol. Once mastered however, it becomes a enjoyable pattern to both watch \n\tand juggle. </p>"

      "description": "    Established by well-known juggler Steven \n\tMills, Mills Mess is one of the most famous 3-ball tricks. It involves a \n\tside-to-side movement of the props, with each one thrown over the other in a \n\tnever ending flow. Despite the much higher complexity of the trick, \n\tMills Mess has the same siteswap as a basic Cascade, with the crossing \n\tmotion of your arms \n\tcreating an extra flare that audiences love.<br/><br/>    \n\tTo learn Mills Mess, it helps to break the trick down \n\tinto smaller pieces. Starting with one ball in your dominant hand, cross \n\tthat arm over the other, and throw the ball across your body to your \n\tnon-dominant hand. At the same time, uncross and recross your arms, this \n\ttime with your non-dominant arm on top, and catch the ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess1ball.gif\" width=\"165\"/>    \n\t<br/>    You have just learned the pattern for the first \n\tball of Mills Mess. \n\tPractice until you are very comfortable leading with either hand, since you \n\tmust be able to perform the throw while managing two other balls. <br/>\n<br/>    The second ball starts out in your non-dominant hand, and is \n\tthrown as your arms are uncrossing—specifically the point at which your two \n\tarms are level with each other. The ball is then caught with your dominant \n\thand, now underneath your non-dominant arm.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess1ball2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>    As before, practice this extensively on both sides. You \n\tshould now be ready to combine the first two steps. Start with one ball in \n\teach hand, arms crossed. Throw the first ball as you uncross your arms, and \n\tthen throw the second ball in the same direction once your arms are level. \n\tThen, recross your arms in the opposite configuration and catch the first \n\tball in your non-dominant hand, and the second ball in your dominant hand.<br/>\n<br/> <img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmess2ball.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>    Once again, practice this until it is second nature. To \n\tcomplete the Mills Mess pattern, we now have to add the third ball. This is \n\tlikely to be the most difficult step, not because the third ball's path is \n\tdifficult, but because you now have to deal with three balls simultaneously. \n\tThe third ball is thrown last, out of your dominant hand. It is caught by \n\tthe hand that throws the first ball of the next cycle. <br/><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/millsmesscycle.gif\" style=\"width: 165px; height: 165px\" width=\"400\"/><br/>    \n\tIt is best to start out practicing one cycle at a time, while making sure \n\tthat all of your throws are clean and accurate. Only then should you try \n\tchaining multiple cycles together. Make sure to maintain the flow of the \n\tballs from left to right, since it is easy to decay into messy, vertical \n\tcolumn throws. The Mills Mess pattern itself is not restricted to three \n\tballs, and can in fact be juggled with four, five, and even six balls, in \n\taddition to other prop types like clubs and rings.</p>"

      "description": "     Chops is a fast paced trick in \n\twhich you swing your arms diagonally across your body while holding a prop. \n\tThe trick is most commonly—and impressively—performed with clubs, though \n\tlearning to do the pattern with balls is a necessary prerequisite.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn Chops, you need to break the trick down into its two \n\tbasic components: the throw and the carry. Unlike in a normal Cascade (with \n\twhich Chops shares a siteswap), the balls in this pattern are thrown in \n\troughly \n\tvertical columns on each side of your body, instead of across. Therefore, \n\tthe first step to learning Chops is to practice the underarm throw. Start by \n\tjuggling the normal Cascade pattern, and then instead of doing a normal \n\tthrow, reach your hand underneath your other arm and throw the ball straight \n\tup. After moving the hand back, resume juggling a normal Cascade.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopsunder.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    This can be a little tricky at first, but you should get the \n\thang of it fairly quickly. Before moving to the next step, it is important \n\tthat you are able to do underarm throws on each side without stopping.<br/>\n<br/>\n    Notice that whenever you make the underarm throw,  you \n\thave to move your other hand out of the way. For the second part of Chops, \n\tthe carry, you are going to exaggerate that arm motion. Instead of merely \n\tmoving your arm to the side, you need to raise it up and the force it down \n\tacross the center of your body. <img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopsfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/>     \n\tOnce you have the \"chop\" motion itself down, you can chain two of them \n\ttogether, with one chop leading into an underarm throw to set up the next \n\tchop.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopstwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Start by just exaggerating two times in a row, and \n\tmake sure you can make the carry quick and concise. The exact manner in \n\twhich you carry the ball is up to you, as skilled jugglers often perform \n\tchops with slightly different styles. Once you have mastered the carry, you \n\tcan cut down on the amount of non-\"chop\" throws made inbetween, until you reach the \n\tpoint where you can do the pattern fully. This may take sometime, since the \n\tspeed of Chops makes the trick hard to perfect. </p>"

This leads to an awkward Mills Mess pattern \n\tin which the third ball, normally thrown under-the-arm, is instead thrown \n\tover-the-arm, meaning that the throw positions of the first and third ball \n\thave been swapped, hence the name Flipped Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Flipped Mess, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Cross your dominant hand \n\tover your non-dominant hand (this is the same configuration you would start in \n\tfor the regular Mills Mess), and then make a throw from your dominant hand \n\tback toward the dominant side your body. You will then make a throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand (still crossed underneath your dominant hand) from \n\tthe center of your body toward the dominant side of your body, clearing \n\tspace for the hand to catch the first ball. Finally, you are going to make a \n\tthrow from your dominant hand toward the center of your body, and then catch \n\tthe second ball with your now empty dominant hand.

To connect both \n\tsides of the pattern together, you are going to make an under-the-arm throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand before it uncrosses to catch the other ball. The \n\thand will then recross <em>over</em> your dominant hand. This position will \n\tset you up to repeat the process on the opposite side of your body, with \n\tyour dominant hand making an under-the-arm throw and catching the ball \n\tthrown from your non-dominant hand.

It combines a stacked multiplex with \n\trapid passes, creating a surprisingly fast-paced pattern. The speed of the \n\ttrick, along with its almost paradoxical high throws, gives the Arrow of \n\tAsai an unusual juggling aesthetic.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Arrow of Asai, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a stacked multiplex \n\tthrow from your dominant hand such that the balls are about 12 inches (30 \n\tcm) apart. As the top ball reaches its peak, make a slam throw (a pass \n\tdirected diagonally downward) from your non-dominant hand to your dominant \n\thand. The slam should be caught by your dominant hand at a height slightly \n\tgreater than the peak of the lower multiplexed ball. After making the slam, \n\tyour non-dominant hand should then claw catch the bottom multiplexed ball \n\t(in a manner similar to what would be done in the Shuffle pattern). After \n\tcatching the slammed ball, your dominant hand will then be pulled between \n\tthe upper and lower multiplexed balls such that it crosses over your \n\tnon-dominant hand. The upper multiplexed ball will then be caught \n\tunder-the-arm by your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaithree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. In the next step we \n\twill add in the other vertical throw and the circular arm flourish. Start by \n\tdoing the same throws described in step one and then, as the upper \n\tmultiplexed ball descends toward your non-dominant hand (which should at \n\tthis point still be underneath your dominant hand), make a vertical throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand along the outside of the descending ball, \n\tclearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the ball. As that \n\tvertical throw is being made, your dominant hand is going to swing around \n\tand pass between the vertical ball just thrown and the caught multiplexed \n\tball. The vertical ball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/arrowofasaithree2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

To \n\trun the full Arrow of Asai, simply make another multiplex throw before \n\tcatching the vertical ball. The timing between the multiplex throw and the \n\tvertical ball catch is a grey area, since it is possible to make the \n\tmultiplex shortly <em>after</em> the other ball is caught, although this \n\tbreaks up the pattern and renders it non-continuous. For the greatest \n\teffect, it is probably best that you make the multiplex either before or at \n\tthe same time as the vertical ball is caught. However, when first learning \n\tthe pattern it is best that you not worry about the timing until you have a \n\tgood grasp on the rest of the trick.</p>"

Bring your non-dominant hand to the center of your body, and \n\tthen simultaneously make a high crossing throw from your dominant hand and a \n\tnearly vertical pass from your non-dominant hand to your now empty dominant \n\thand. The pass should be caught at around head height. You will then hold \n\tthe ball in your dominant hand up in the air until the other ball reaches \n\tits peak, making sure to shift your dominant hand over slightly to the \n\tcenter of your body. When the other ball reaches its peak and begins to \n\tdescend you are going to drop the ball in your dominant hand so that it \n\tfollows a similar arc to the other ball (just a lot lower). You will then \n\trapidly bring your dominant hand down and around to catch the ball it just \n\tdropped, while at the same time catching the other ball above it in your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/flyingdiscodroptwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Make a high crossing throw from your dominant hand and \n\tthen, as that ball descends, perform the same throws you did in step one, \n\tcatching the high crossing throw you previously made in your now empty \n\tnon-dominant hand. As you carry and then drop the ball in your dominant hand \n\t(as you did in step one) you are going to make an under-the arm vertical \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of your body, \n\tclearing space for that hand to catch the top ball while your dominant hand \n\tcatches the bottom ball (as you also did in step one).

There is just one more throw \n\tleft to complete the cycle. Start by performing all of the same throws and \n\tcatches that you did in step two, except before you catch the vertical ball \n\tat the end you are going to make a high under-the-arm throw from your \n\tdominant hand back toward the dominant side of your body, clearing space for \n\tyour dominant hand to catch the vertical ball.

This trick is fast paced and looks pretty cool, especially \n\twhen combined with other Box patterns. Before learning Luke's Shuffle, it \n\twould be wise to already know both the Box and the Shuffle, since parts of \n\tboth tricks are included in this pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n    The first step to learning Luke's Shuffle is to split the \n\ttrick roughly in half, and practice the slam throw with two balls. Start \n\twith one ball in each hand. Then, throw the ball in your dominant hand \n\tstraight up, while simultaneously passing the ball in your other hand toward \n\tyour now empty dominant hand (as if juggling the normal Box). Once that \n\tsecond ball is caught, bring that hand up over the first ball, and do a slam \n\tthrow out of your dominant hand, claw catching the first ball on your way \n\tdown.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/lukesuffletwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/>\n    Practice this extensively on both sides. Once you can perform \n\tthe slam throw consistently, it is time to add it in to the full pattern. \n\tStart by juggling a normal Box, and then do a slam throw with your dominant \n\thand. After the slam throw is caught by your non-dominant hand, perform \n\tanother slam throw with that hand, and then return to the normal Box \n\tpattern.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/lukeshufflerun.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    This is one cycle of Luke's Shuffle, and as you become more \n\tcomfortable with the trick, you can add in more cycles. With practice, you \n\twill get to the point where you can juggle the pattern for extended periods \n\tof time, at which point it is safe to say you have learned Luke's Shuffle.</p>"

A third ball is then thrown underneath the synchronous balls in a \n\tCascade-like manner. When performed properly, Al's Slide is a fairly \n\tgraceful pattern, with the midair catch flowing naturally from the throwing \n\tmotion preceding it.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Al's Slide, start with one ball in each \n\thand. Position your hands so that your dominant hand is at the outside of \n\tyour body, while your non-dominant hand is roughly at the center. \n\tSimultaneously make a throw from each hand such that the balls travel across \n\tyour body toward the opposite side. Now comes the tricky part. As you make \n\tthe throws, continue the motion of your dominant hand such that it follows \n\tthe ball thrown from the center by your non-dominant hand. Once that ball \n\treaches its peak, catch it (but do not claw catch it<em>)</em>, and then \n\tlower your dominant hand and bring it back to the dominant side of your \n\tbody. As your dominant hand is being lowered, you are going to catch the \n\tball originally thrown by your dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidetwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third \n\tball, start with two balls in your non-dominant hand and one ball in your \n\tdominant hand. Make the two simultaneous throws and then use your dominant \n\thand to catch the outside ball at its peak (this is all from step one). As \n\tthe other ball begins to descend toward your non-dominant hand, make a \n\tCascade throw from the center of your body using your non-dominant hand. \n\tThis will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the other ball. By \n\tthis point your dominant hand should be returning to its original position \n\talong the dominant side of your body, where it will catch the third ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. You have just \n\tcompleted one full cycle of Al's Slide. Intuitively, you might be able to \n\teasily figure out how the cycles connect together, in which case you are \n\tfinished with this tutorial. If you can't however, here is one more step to \n\tpractice. Start by juggling the same throws shown above, but instead of \n\tsimply catching the last ball with your dominant hand (which previously had \n\tcaught the outside synchronous ball midair), you are going to make a second \n\tset of synchronous throws, with your dominant hand now in the center and \n\tyour non-dominant hand on the outside (the opposite configuration from when \n\tthey started). Catch the balls with whatever hand feels most comfortable, \n\tsince it is only the throws that are significant in this case.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alsslidefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice this on both sides as shown in the \n\tanimation. Notice that the second pair of synchronous throws sets you up for \n\ta new cycle of the pattern on the opposite side if your body. To run the \n\tfull Al's Slide, simply perform a midair catch on the outside ball and then \n\tmake another Cascade throw with your other hand. By this point you should \n\tbegin recognizing the pattern and be able to continue it from memory. Al's \n\tSlide is a fairly simple pattern, but will take some practice to make smooth \n\tand graceful. </p>"

Start with two balls in your dominant hand, and then cross your \n\tdominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand. Make a high throw and then \n\tuncross and recross your hands such that your dominant hand is now on top. \n\tRight as your hands are uncrossed, make a pass from your dominant hand to \n\tyour non-dominant hand, and then finish crossing your arms.

It contains an odd mix of synchronous throws, high throws, and \n\twrist-drops. The trick has a very rushed cadence, and this, along with its \n\twide variety of throws, makes Alex quite hard to master. There are no true \n\tprerequisite patterns, but it would probably help to be well versed in \n\tgeneral three ball juggling before attempting this trick.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Alex, start with one ball in each hand. \n\tCross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand, but keep both hands \n\tfairly close to the center of your body. Simultaneously, make a roughly \n\tvertical throw from each hand such that the ball from your dominant hand \n\tgoes roughly twice as high as the ball thrown from your non-dominant hand \n\t(measured from the palm of your hand). As the lower ball reaches its peak, \n\tyou are going to grab it out of the air with your dominant hand and then \n\trecross your arms such that the palm of your dominant hand is pointing \n\ttoward the ground. You will catch the second ball under-the-arm with your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alextwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. For the next step, you are going \n\tto add in the wrist-drop. A wrist-drop occurs when, in a crossed-arm \n\tposition, the top hand releases its ball and then quickly uncrosses and \n\trecrosses underneath the other hand, catching the ball that it had just \n\treleased. In Alex the wrist-drop occurs after the first catch of the \n\tprevious step, when your dominant hand grabs the lower ball. After that \n\tcatch is made, you are going to release the ball in your dominant hand with \n\ta small amount of upward movement, giving you enough time to recross your \n\tdominant hand underneath your non-dominant hand, catching the released ball \n\tpalm-up as your hand moves into position. The other ball should be caught by \n\tyour non-dominant just as you begin to uncross your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alextwo2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. To add in the third \n\tball, you are going to start with two balls in your dominant hand and one \n\tball in your non-dominant. Make a high vertical throw from your dominant \n\thand along the outside of your body, then cross your dominant hand over your \n\tnon-dominant hand and make the simultaneous throws from the previous two \n\tsteps, catching the outside vertical ball with your now empty non-dominant \n\thand (which at this point is crossed underneath your dominant hand). Grab \n\tthe lower ball out of the air with your dominant hand and execute the \n\twrist-drop from step two. As you do this, you are also going to make a high \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand along the outside of the upper ball, which \n\tshould now be descending toward your non-dominant hand where it will then be \n\tcaught. The high ball will then be caught by your dominant hand, which \n\tshould now be crossed underneath your non-dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/alexthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this extensively on both sides. To run the full \n\tpattern, simply make another set of simultaneous throws underneath the last \n\thigh ball, setting up a new cycle on the opposite side of your body.

It \n\tcan be plainly seen in the animation that one hand is making a constant \n\toverthrow, while the other hand is making constant underthrows. This is even \n\tmore evident if we exaggerate the height of each throw (as seen on the \n\tright).<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"167\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/halfshowerexaggerated.gif\" width=\"168\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tFor the sake of this tutorial I will be assuming that you are already able \n\tto perform Juggler's Tennis without too much trouble. If you are not \n\tfamiliar with the trick, go learn it; that way you will have a good grasp on \n\tdoing overthrows. Practicing the Half-Shower is rather simple. Start by \n\tdoing a single overthrow, and then do a second overthrow from that same \n\thand. After you do that, fall back into the regular Cascade. The idea is to \n\tslowly add in more overthrows as you are practicing.

This trick can also \n\tbe seen as a Shower with continuous Tossouts. I gave the Broken Shower its \n\tname based on its resemblance to the Broken Box, which also uses an underarm \n\tcatch. Before attempting the Broken Shower, it would be wise to learn the \n\tShower Cascade, since that pattern prepare you for the underarm catch. <br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Broken Shower, start with one ball in each hand. \n\tBring your dominant hand to the center of your body, and then raise it up \n\tabout six inches. Make a fairly high throw from your dominant hand toward \n\tthe dominant side of your body (the opposite direction of a normal Shower), \n\twhile simultaneously making a pass from your non-dominant hand (which should \n\tbe raised higher than your dominant hand). After your non-dominant hand \n\tmakes the pass, continue the motion so that your non-dominant hand crosses \n\tunderneath your dominant hand. Use it to catch the high throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenshowertwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can do the throw/pass combination \n\tconsistently.

This time however, you are going to make a high throw \n\tfrom your dominant hand without the corresponding pass from your \n\tnon-dominant hand. As that ball reaches its peak and begins to descend, make \n\ta pass from your non-dominant hand, and then cross that hand underneath your \n\tdominant arm to catch the high throw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenshowertwo2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Once again, practice these two throw until you can do them \n\tconsistently.

Make a high throw from your \n\tdominant hand at the center of your body (as done in the previous steps) and \n\tthen, as that ball descends toward your dominant side, make a second high \n\tthrow from your dominant hand paired with a pass from your non-dominant hand \n\t(as done in step one). Cross your non-dominant hand underneath your dominant \n\tarm and then catch the first high throw (as done in step two).

To run the full \n\tBroken Shower, simply make another throw/pass combination as the second high \n\tthrow begins to descend. Instead of catching that ball with your dominant \n\thand (as done in the step above), you are going to cross over and catch it \n\twith your non-dominant hand, thus replicating the previous throw/pass \n\tcombination.

This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the second \n\tball (the vertical throw made from your non-dominant hand before it \n\tuncrossed). The third ball will then be caught from above with your \n\tnon-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

The throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand should be very light, and in fact more closely \n\tresembles a simple drop. After your non-dominant hand claw catches its ball, \n\tyou are going to cross it underneath your dominant hand, which itself is \n\tgoing to cross over and catch the ball dropped from your non-dominant hand. \n\tThus your hands will end up crossed in the opposite configuration from when \n\tthey started (note that the animation below cheats, since it doesn't uncross \n\tand recross its hands when it begins a new cycle).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenthree2.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides.

At this point we have \n\tcompleted one full cycle of the Kraken. From here, you might intuitively be \n\table to figure out how the cycles connect, at which point you will be able \n\tto juggle the full pattern. If however you are not quite able to see the \n\tcontinuation, there is one more step to practice. Start by juggling one full \n\tcycle (i.e. juggle the previous step) and then, instead of simply catching \n\tthe last ball with your non-dominant hand, you are going to make a vertical \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand along the outside of that ball, clearing \n\tspace for your non-dominant hand to catch it. At this point your dominant \n\thand should be crossed over your non-dominant hand. As that outside vertical \n\tball just thrown by your non-dominant hand reaches its peak, you are going \n\tto make a vertical throw from your dominant hand and then uncross that hand, \n\tclaw catching the vertical ball thrown from your non-dominant hand. You will then catch the vertical ball just \n\tthrown from your dominant hand with your non-dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/krakenfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. Notice how the final \n\tclaw catch mirrors the claw catch performed at the beginning. That last claw \n\tcatch signals the beginning of a new cycle (on the opposite side of your \n\tbody). To juggle the full Kraken, simply make another vertical throw \n\tunderneath the claw-caught ball, and repeat the same throws and catches that \n\tyou've been practicing in the previous steps. By this point, your brain will \n\tlikely be familiar enough with the pattern to repeat the cycle on its own, \n\tbut if you get stuck, simply refer back the previous steps. The Kraken has \n\tan odd rhythm that will take some practice to master, so expect to spend a \n\tdecent amount of time working with this pattern. </p>"

The harmonious combination of the two arm \n\tmovements gives Jeanne a very smooth and complex flow. Before trying this \n\tpattern, it is important that you already be able to juggle Orka's Mess and \n\tRubenstein's Revenge.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Jeanne, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Raise your dominant hand up \n\tand then cross your non-dominant hand underneath it such that the balls are \n\tlined up along a single vertical axis. Simultaneously make a throw from each \n\thand toward the opposite (non-dominant) side of your body, and then follow \n\tthat up with a throw from your dominant also directed toward the opposite \n\tside of your body. This throw will clear space for your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the top ball from the simultaneous pair (the same ball that it threw) \n\twhile your non-dominant hand catches the bottom ball. At this point your \n\tdominant hand should be crossed over your non-dominant hand, as your \n\tnon-dominant hand then makes a vertical throw along the dominant side of \n\tyour body. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch the \n\tsecond ball thrown from your dominant hand. While this is happening, your \n\tdominant hand will spin around between the ball thrown and ball being caught \n\twith your non-dominant hand, crossing underneath your non-dominant hand. So \n\tfar, this has all been identical to Orka's Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n    However, as your dominant hand rotates into position, you \n\twill begin to swing your non-dominant hand around along roughly the same \n\tpath, making an under-the-arm throw from your dominant hand toward the \n\tcenter of your body as your dominant hand finishes its rotation (your \n\tnon-dominant hand should be about halfway through its own swing by this \n\ttime). This throw will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the \n\tvertical ball thrown from your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of \n\tyour body. Your non-dominant hand will then finish its rotation, ending up \n\tstill crossed over your dominant hand and positioned near the non-dominant \n\tside of your body, catching the last ball thrown from your dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/jeannefull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. In this step you are \n\tessentially grafting part of Rubenstein's Revenge on to the end of Orka's \n\tMess, so while the written instructions above may seem long, the actual \n\tthrows themselves should feel very natural (until the last throw or two) if \n\tyou already know Orka's Mess.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To juggle the full Jeanne pattern, simply make another set of \n\tsimultaneous throws using both hands before catching the last ball with your \n\tnon-dominant hand. This will begin a new cycle of the trick, with the hand \n\tpositions reversed. Jeanne is a very graceful pattern that is both enjoyable \n\tto juggle and watch. Assuming you already have the prerequisite patterns \n\tmastered, this trick should not be very hard to learn.</p>"

This trick looks decent—though the other \n\ttower patterns look better—but is a pain to learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tTaking a close look at the trick, we can see that there are three throws: a \n\thigh throw (5), a low throw (3), and a horizontal pass (1). We can also see \n\tthat the highest throw and the pass alternate balls, while a single ball is \n\tused for the lower throw.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"130\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531colored.gif\" width=\"130\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tIt is best to begin learning the 531 by practicing the high throw and the \n\tpass. Start with two balls in your dominant hand. Throw one ball high across \n\tyour body, and immediately make a horizontal pass to your other hand. Then, \n\tusing that ball you just passed, you are going to make another high throw \n\tacross your body, and then catch the first ball you threw.

These two throws are \n\tidentical to the ones made in the 531, and the third ball fits into the \n\tspace between them. For the next step, you are going to practice making that \n\tlower throw. Start with one ball in each hand. Make one high throw, and then \n\tmake a lower throw (less than a normal cascade throw) with the other ball. \n\tYou want to time these throws so that the second ball (low height) lands in \n\tyour hand slightly before the high throw:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531secondstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tThis is an important step. The timing of these two throws must be \n\tconsistent, or your entire pattern will fall apart. Once you have the \n\tprevious steps mastered, you are ready to put everything together. Start \n\twith three balls—two in your dominant hand, one in your non-dominant. Throw \n\tone ball high across your body, then a low throw from the other hand, then \n\timmediately do a pass from your dominant hand. Using that ball you just \n\tpassed, make another high throw (going the other way), and repeat the cycle:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle2\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/531thirdstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tYou have just done a full run of the 531. It is very important that you \n\tpractice both sides evenly, as running the trick for any length of time will \n\trequire many throws from both sides. The 531 is not an easy or pleasant \n\ttrick to master. The timing will feel rushed and awkward at first, and the \n\ttrick itself is only somewhat pleasing to the eye.</p>"

The trick consists of an upward diagonal pass \n\tfollowed by a traditional Factory carry, with most of the added complexity \n\tcoming from the pass. For obvious reasons, you should already be comfortable \n\twith the standard Factories before attempting this pattern, and it helps to know the \n\tN-Box as well (though this isn't necessary).<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning the Zebra Factory, start with one ball in \n\teach hand. Make an upward diagonal throw from your non-dominant hand toward \n\tyour dominant side, while simultaneously throwing the ball in your dominant \n\thand underneath the diagonal ball in an arc toward your non-dominant hand. \n\tYou will then raise your now empty dominant hand and catch the diagonal ball \n\tat about shoulder height. As the other ball begins to descend toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand, you will horizontally shift your dominant hand to the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body (as if doing the Factory). Lastly, you will \n\tcatch the second ball with your non-dominant hand. The ball carried in your \n\tdominant hand is not thrown.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/zebrafactorytwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this step until you are very comfortable making the \n\ttwo throws.

Make a diagonal pass \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand and an arcing throw from your dominant hand (as \n\tyou did in step one) and then, as the arcing ball descends toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand and as your dominant hand is finishing its carry, you are \n\tgoing to throw the second ball in your non-dominant hand toward the dominant \n\tside of your body. This will clear space for your non-dominant hand to catch \n\tthe arcing ball thrown at the beginning. As the ball just thrown by your \n\tnon-dominant hand reaches its peak, you are going to drop the ball in your \n\tdominant hand and quickly snatch the other ball at its peak (just as you \n\twould in the Factory). As the dropped ball is descending toward your \n\tnon-dominant hand, you will make a roughly vertical throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand near the center of your body, clearing space for your hand \n\tto catch the dropped ball.

With this in mind, it would be wise for you \n\tto already be comfortable with Rubenstein's Revenge and Romeo's Revenge \n\tbefore attempting this pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n   To begin learning Relf's Rubensteins, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Cross your dominant \n\thand underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a vertical \n\tunder-the-arm throw from dominant hand. As you do this you are also going to \n\tbegin uncrossing and then recrossing your arms The first ball should be \n\tdescending just as you complete the recrossing, so you will then make an \n\tunder-the-arm throw from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant \n\tside of your body, clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the \n\tfirst ball. You will then swing your dominant hand (which should at this \n\tpoint be crossed over your non-dominant hand) under, around, and then above \n\tthe thrown ball. So far this has all been identical to Rubenstein's Revenge. \n\tHowever, instead of claw catching the ball in the air you are going to \n\tfollow it with your dominant hand as the ball descends. You will then make a \n\tsecond under-the-arm throw—vertical this time—from your non-dominant hand, \n\tclearing space for the hand to catch the first ball it threw (the ball your \n\tdominant hand is following).

You will then continue the downward motion of the \n\tclaw catch and recross your dominant hand over your non-dominant hand.

      "description": "     Tom's Trick (unofficial name) \n\tis a three ball pattern established by Thomas Wood. It is essentially the \n\tBoston Shuffle with a chop inserted before each slam. The pattern gained a \n\tbit of infamy after being touted as \"mathematically impossible,\" though this \n\tclaim was easily debunked by Nathan Peterson in his\n\t<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uIcc6O7irU\">tutorial video </a>\n\t(note that his asymetric interpretation is slightly different than my own, \n\tsince I am referencing a more direct demonstration posted by Woods after \n\tPeterson had solved the trick). Ironically this \"mathematically impossible\" \n\ttrick is actually a fairly easy three ball pattern, as long as you are \n\talready comfortable with Chops and the Boston Shuffle.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Tom's Trick, start with two balls in your \n\tnon-dominant hand and one ball in your dominant. Raise your dominant arm up \n\tand shift your non-dominant hand to the center of your body. Perform a chop \n\twith your dominant hand while simultaneously making a fairly vertical \n\tunder-the-arm throw along the dominant side of your body with your \n\tnon-dominant hand. As that ball reaches its peak and begins to descend your \n\tdominant hand should be finishing its chop. Once that arm motion is finished \n\tyou are going to make a throw from your dominant hand toward the \n\tnon-dominant side of your body, clearing space for your dominant hand to \n\tcatch the under-the-arm throw. Your non-dominant hand will then perform a \n\tslam throw to your dominant hand, claw catching the ball your dominant hand \n\tjust threw.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/tomstrickthree.gif\" width=\"404\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides. For the next step you \n\tare going to make a throw from your dominant hand toward the non-dominant \n\tside of your body before catching the slammed ball (instead of simply \n\tcatching and holding both balls as done in the previous step). As that ball \n\tcrosses through the center of your body, make a normal Cascade-style throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand toward your dominant hand. After that throw you \n\tare going to raise your non-dominant hand up and grab out of the air the \n\tball that had been thrown by your dominant hand. You will then perform a \n\tchop with your non-dominant hand while simultaneously making an \n\tunder-the-arm throw with your dominant hand, clearing space for that hand to \n\tcatch the Cascade throw previously made by your non-dominant hand. The \n\tunder-the-arm throw will be caught by your non-dominant hand after the chop \n\tis completed.<img alt=\"\" height=\"486\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/tomstrickfull.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this on both sides. Notice how the final \n\tunder-the-arm throw and chop are a mirror image of how you started. To \n\tcontinue the pattern simply repeat the step using the opposite hand \n\tconfiguration. Overall Tom's Trick is a relatively easy pattern to master \n\twhile being surprisingly enjoyable to juggle.</p>"

      "description": "\n   \nThe Chop Shower is a Windmill variation that incorporates a fast chopping arm motion, in an opposing direction to the ball flight paths.\nOnce the Windmill pattern has been mastered, an obvious and popular mutation is to switch which arm crosses over the other when reaching\nacross your body to catch. While more difficult than the standard Windmill, this variation can often appear awkward and usually has less visual\nappeal. By simply supplementing this variation an additional chop element, the Chop Shower establishes a more mechanically\nstable and balanced pattern while also improving the overall appearance.<br/><br/>\n\n   \nTo learn the Chop Shower, start with the base Windmill pattern. Notice that each arm plays a different role; one arm can be described as the\ntop arm and the other serves as the bottom arm. While maintaining the same ball paths, switch the arm roles. As noted above, this will likely\nfeel quite awkward. The next step is to note where the top arm is catching the ball, and raise that point so that your forearm is vertically\noriented when the catch is made. This higher catch reduces the in-flight time, allowing time for a chop to be made prior to the next throw\nby that hand. For the chop, try to keep your elbow close to your body and as stationary as possible, so that your forearm rotates like the\nhand of a clock. Drill a single strong and rapid chop until you have locked this movement into muscle memory.\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopshower_start.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/><br/>\n\n   \nAfter you are comfortable with chopping as depicted above, attempt to mix a chop into the Windmill, swiping the chopped ball between the other\ntwo. Then progress to chopping the same ball every time, then every other catch, then two consecutive chops. After completing each of these steps,\nyou soon should be able to run the pattern without much further difficulty.\n<br/><br/>\n\n   \nFor optimal clarity, try not to carry the chopped ball in front of or behind a thrown ball. If you are having trouble carrying the chopped ball\nbetween the other two balls, you can experiment with either chopping over both of the other two balls, or underneath them, as shown below. Depending\nupon the length of your arms and chopping speed, one of these variations may seem more natural. Both of them maintain the fundamental identity of\nthe pattern and are worth the investment to attempt.\n<table align=\"center\"><tr>\n<td>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopshower_over.gif\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n<td>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/chopshower_under.gif\" width=\"400\"/></td>\n</tr></table>\n<br/><br/>\n\n   \nAs a standalone and simple repeating pattern, the Chop Shower has legitimate merit. However, it is perhaps better-utilized as a mechanical concept\nto enhance other patterns containing crossed-arm movements. The quarter-circle carry of the chopped ball supplies a nice contrast to the\nparabolic thrown ball arches. For example, it can easily be mixed with the Shower, Mills Mess, and/or the Crossed-Arm Reverse Cascade to construct\ninteresting new patterns. Plenty of symmetric pattern possibilities should be apparent after learning it in both directions.\n<br/><br/>\n<strong>Tutorial created and submitted by Andrew Olson. </strong>\n</p>"

For this reason it's important that you already be \n\tcomfortable with the Follow before attempting Relf's Revenge, and it also \n\tprobably wouldn't hurt to know the Weave (another 423 trick).<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Relf's Revenge, start with two balls in \n\tyour dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Raise your \n\tnon-dominant hand up to about shoulder height, and then bring both hands to \n\tthe center of your body such that your dominant hand is positioned under \n\tyour non-dominant hand. Then make an under-the-arm throw from your dominant \n\thand back toward the dominant side of your body while simultaneously \n\tswinging your non-dominant hand in a circle around and then under the thrown ball. \n\tAs that ball peaks and begins to descend you will follow it from above with \n\tyour non-dominant hand, which should have finished circling around. Your \n\tdominant hand will then make a second under-the-arm throw from the same \n\tposition as the first, though the throw itself should be more \n\tvertical. This will clear space for your dominant hand to catch the first \n\tball, after which you will catch the second ball with your non-dominant \n\thand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"448\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/relfsrevengethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    As shown, practice this on both sides.

Your non-dominant hand, having been following the first ball, \n\twill slide down along the inside of your dominant hand, which will in turn \n\tbegin to shift up and around such that it ends up close to the center of your body \n\tat about shoulder height. At this point the second ball (the last throw you \n\tmade in first step) will be descending, so you will make an under-the-arm \n\tthrow from your non-dominant hand back toward the non-dominant side of your \n\tbody before catching the second ball with your non-dominant hand. As this \n\tthird throw is being made your dominant hand will swing around and then \n\tunder the thrown ball.

Notice how the arm \n\tmotion you did with your dominant hand is a mirror image of the one you did \n\tat the beginning with your non-dominant hand. To continue the pattern simply \n\tmake a second under-the-arm throw with your non-dominant hand and then use \n\tit catch the ball being followed by your dominant hand. This will set you up \n\tto repeat the circular arm flourish with your non-dominant hand, at which \n\tpoint you are right back where you started. Relf's Revenge is not an \n\tespecially hard pattern, but its rarity will make the trick more impressive \n\tto other jugglers. </p>"

This Fork quickly separates the multiplexed \n\tballs, allowing for extra throws/catches to be made while also creating a \n\tvery unique aesthetic. The actual throws made in the Forklift are fairly \n\tsimple, but controlling the Fork \"throw\" takes a fair amount of practice.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Forklift, it is best to begin by practicing the \n\tFork. Start with two balls in your non-dominant hand, and then make a fairly \n\tvertical throw at the center of your body. As this ball reaches its peak, \n\tyou are going to make a second vertical throw underneath it from your \n\tnon-dominant hand while simultaneously pushing the first ball upwards using \n\tthe first two fingers of your dominant hand (your palm should be facing \n\tdownward). If done correctly, the first ball should stay in the same \n\tvertical column as the second ball, and the distance between the two balls \n\tshould remain roughly the same.

After that ball is caught, you are going to bring your dominant hand \n\tunderneath the multiplexed ball that is farthest away from your dominant \n\tside. Simultaneously, you are going to bring your non-dominant hand directly \n\tunderneath the multiplexed ball closest to it (the same ball that your \n\tdominant hand is now under). Once your hands are in these positions, you are \n\tgoing to make a vertical throw from your dominant hand, immediately followed \n\tby a vertical Fork \"throw\". These two throws are identical to the ones \n\tpracticed in step one. Your dominant hand will now be free to catch the \n\tother multiplexed ball, while your non-dominant hand will claw catch the \n\tvertical ball just thrown from your dominant hand.

You will therefore want to be very comfortable with both \n\tof these tricks before attempting Harrison's Hang.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To begin learning Harrison's Hang, start with two balls in \n\tyour dominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant hand. Shift your \n\tdominant hand over to the non-dominant side of your body, and then raise \n\tyour non-dominant hand such that it is positioned over your dominant hand. \n\tMake a throw from your dominant hand toward the center of your body while \n\tsimultaneously swinging your non-dominant hand around in a three-quarter \n\tcircle such that it passes inside of, under, and then outside of the ball \n\tyour dominant hand just threw. As that ball descends and as your \n\tnon-dominant hand completes its partial circle you are going to move your \n\tdominant hand directly underneath your non-dominant hand, and then make a \n\tvertical pass from your dominant hand to your non-dominant hand, clearing \n\tspace for your dominant hand to catch the first ball it threw. At the same \n\ttime you will make a vertical throw from your non-dominant hand (with your \n\tpalm facing down), clearing space for your non-dominant hand to catch the \n\tvertical pass.

To connect two cycles together \n\t(i.e. to connect both sides of the pattern) you are going to take your \n\tnon-dominant hand, which just caught the vertical pass, and cross it over to \n\tthe dominant side of your body; you will then make a throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand toward the center of your body. At the same time you will \n\traise your dominant hand and begin moving it in the same three-quarter \n\tcircle that your non-dominant hand did at the very beginning—rotating \n\tinside of, under, and then outside of the ball thrown by your non-dominant \n\thand.

This makes the horizontal pass more difficult, since you need to \n\tmove your receiving hand into position while the ball is in the air. The \n\tdifficulty of the pass, combined with cramped vertical throws, makes the \n\tBroken Box a fairly hard variation to master.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Broken Box, start with one ball in each hand. \n\tMake a vertical throw from your dominant hand coupled with a horizontal pass \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand, just like in the regular Box. However, as you \n\tare throwing the horizontal pass, continue the motion of your arm so that it \n\tcrossed underneath your dominant hand. At this moment, the vertical ball \n\tshould be at its peak, and your non-dominant hand should be crossed \n\tunderneath your dominant hand. As the vertical ball begins to descend back \n\ttoward your dominant hand, make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand \n\twhile simultaneously uncrossing your non-dominant hand to receive the ball. \n\tThis pass should clear space for your dominant hand to catch the vertical \n\tball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenboxtwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can make the vertical throw and \n\thorizontal passes consistently.

Make a \n\tvertical throw from your dominant hand at the very outside of your body, and \n\tthen follow it up with a second vertical throw from your dominant hand, this \n\ttime closer to the center of your body. Simultaneously, make a horizontal \n\tpass from your non-dominant hand, just like you did in the previous step. \n\tAfter you make the horizontal pass, cross your non-dominant hand underneath \n\tyour dominant arm and catch the first vertical throw. Catch the second \n\tvertical throw with your dominant hand.\n\t<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/brokenboxthree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    While practicing these throws, it may help to raise your \n\tdominant hand up several inches to allow your non-dominant hand to cross \n\tunderneath more easily (as shown in the animation above). Once you have \n\tthese throws mastered, you will be ready for the final step. As the second \n\tvertical ball approaches your dominant hand, as it does at the end of the \n\tprevious step, you are going to make a third vertical throw, from your \n\tnon-dominant hand, and then make a horizontal pass from your dominant hand \n\tto your non-dominant hand, which will have to quickly uncross and return to \n\tthe other side of your body to receive the ball.

Start with two balls, one in each hand, and arms crossed. Uncross \n\tand recross your arms, then throw a ball vertically from your bottom hand \n\t(which started out on top).

      "description": "\n     Levels is a multi-level shape distortion of the Extended Box (a.k.a Double Box) that incorporates\nseveral different types of throws into a symmetric and visually appealing pattern. It is a moderately difficult pattern,\nbut when properly executed, its difficulty is well-hidden by the apparent simplicity. Because its shape is quite simple,\nthis is a fantastic base pattern from which many interesting variations can be found, similar to the Box itself.<br/>\n<br/>\n     To learn the Levels pattern, you can start by introducing a Luke's Shuffle-style slam throw into the\nstandard Box pattern. Keep this throw as horizontal as possible, such that it is caught at a higher\nelevation than normal, and the concurrent Box throw from the opposite hand is thrown to an even greater height. Next,\nrelease the shuffled-over ball so that it falls downward and then very quickly move that same hand upward to catch the ball it just\nthrew. This catch should occur at the top of the pattern, while the other hand tosses a low throw in the center of\nyour body, or even slightly on the other side of your body as an underarm throw. Finally, slam the ball which was caught\nat the top of the pattern down and subsequently claw the center ball, as in the N-Box, and proceed juggling\nthe Box.<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/levels_start.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n<br/>\n     Practice this 3-beat sequence on both sides. Once you are comfortable with these throws, the final step\nis to simply change the last N-Box throw into the initial Luke's Shuffle throw for the flipped cycle, then continue repeating\nthe pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n     One key aspect to understanding this pattern is that the vertical throw on each side must be caught\nwhen the ball has reached its peak. Your hand therefore needs to chase up after the ball immediately\nafter throwing it, stopping midway to perform a very quick catch and release of the ball being thrown down\ndiagonally from the top of the other side of the pattern. The angle of this diagonal throw is somewhere in\nbetween an N-Box slam and a horizontal Inverted Box throw, since it is caught at the middle level\nof the pattern.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Tutorial created and submitted by Andrew Olson. </strong>\n</p>"

This \n\tpattern lacks the more intuitive flow of Mills Mess, and doesn't look as \n\tcool to spectators.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Boston Mess, it is best to start by juggling The \n\tW. After catching an inside throw with your dominant hand (the outside ball \n\ton your dominant hand side should be in the air), make an outside throw with \n\tyour non-dominant hand and then cross that hand under your dominant hand, \n\tcatching the outside ball usually caught by your dominant hand. Then throw \n\tthe center ball currently in your dominant hand, clearing space to allow \n\tthat hand to catch the outside ball normally caught by your non-dominant \n\thand (essentially your hands have switched which balls they are throwing \n\twithout changing the overall shape of the pattern).<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonmesstwo.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until it is second nature, since the next step \n\tis simply going to add more throws to the sequence. After the last throw of \n\tprevious step, you should end up with your arms crossed and the center ball \n\tin the air. As that ball comes down, you are going to make an outside throw \n\twith your non-dominant hand (which should be crossed under your dominant \n\thand) and catch the center ball. Then, as that outside throw is coming down, \n\tyou are going to make an outside throw with your dominant hand, and then \n\tuncross your arms, catching the non-dominant hand's outside throw. Finally, \n\tas that last outside throw is coming down, you are going to make a center \n\tthrow with your non-dominant hand and catch the outside ball.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/bostonmessnext.gif\" width=\"400\"/>\n<br/>\n    Again, practice this step until it is second nature. At this \n\tpoint, the Boston Mess pretty much starts over back at step one, with your \n\tdominant hand making an outside throw and catching the center ball, and your \n\tnon-dominant hand reaching over to grab the outside ball normally caught by \n\tyour dominant hand. However, as you may have noticed, the full Boston Mess \n\talternates the top hand, such that after you complete one cycle with your \n\tdominant hand crossed over your non-dominant hand, the next cycle will have \n\tyour non-dominant hand crossed over your dominant hand. This doesn't \n\tactually change the order of the throws, it just alters the relative \n\tposition of your hands. The Boston Mess is a pretty difficult pattern to \n\tfigure out, so if you are still unable to perform the pattern, try following \n\tone of the other tutorials listed at the top right corner of this page.  </p>"

This fusion of parts from \n\ttwo very different tricks results in a pattern with a highly distinct timing \n\tand feel. Before attempting the Georgian Scuffle, you should already be very \n\tfamiliar with the Georgian Shuffle. Experience with the Kraken will also \n\tmake the pattern much easier to learn, though this is not required.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To learn the Georgian Scuffle, start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand and one ball in your non-dominant. Make a fake throw from your \n\tnon-dominant hand back to itself (as would be done in the Georgian Shuffle) \n\tand then, as you catch the ball, make a split multiplex from your dominant \n\thand. As the balls reach their peak, claw catch the ball furthest from your \n\tdominant hand with that hand. As you claw catch the \n\tmultiplexed ball, you are going to make an under-the-arm vertical throw \n\tfrom your non-dominant hand along the dominant side of your body, clearing \n\tspace for your non-dominant hand to catch the other multiplexed ball (the \n\tone that was closest to your dominant hand). So far these throws and catches \n\thave been identical to those in the Georgian Shuffle. <br/>\n<br/>\n    As that vertical ball reaches \n\tits peak, you are going to basically drop the ball in your dominant hand \n\t(you will still give the ball a bit of upward motion as you release it) and \n\tthen use that same hand to claw catch the vertical ball. As the ball dropped \n\tfrom your dominant hand approaches your non-dominant hand, you are going to \n\tmake a throw along the center of your body using your non-dominant hand, \n\twhich will then catch the ball dropped from your dominant hand. The center \n\tball will then be caught by your dominant hand.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianscufflethree.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    Practice this until you can perform and catch all the throws \n\tconsistently, especially the midair drop. For the next step you are going to \n\tadd in a second midair drop from your dominant hand, using the ball that was \n\tcaught after the first midair drop (the ball that was grabbed from the air \n\tawkwardly at the end of the previous animation). After performing the drop, \n\tyou are going to claw catch the center ball thrown from your non-dominant \n\thand out of the air. Simultaneously, you are going to bring your \n\tnon-dominant hand, which should have recently caught a ball, over to the \n\tdominant side of your body, where it will make a vertical throw along the \n\toutside of the ball your dominant hand dropped. This will clear space for \n\tyour non-dominant hand to catch that dropped ball. You will then take your \n\tdominant hand, which just caught the center ball, and circle it over and \n\taround the vertical ball just thrown from your non-dominant hand, catching \n\tit as you finish.<img alt=\"\" height=\"450\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/georgianscufflefinal.gif\" width=\"400\"/><br/>\n    To run the full pattern, simply make another fake throw from \n\tyour non-dominant hand as your dominant hand is catching the final ball. \n\tThis will set you up for the next cycle. The Georgian Scuffle benefits from \n\ta quick pace, so you will want to make the pattern as small and fast as \n\tpossible.  </p>"

The difficulty level of this pattern is about the same as that of the Kraken and other common mess variations like Romeo's Revenge, although Frostbite's somewhat more complex siteswap and coordinated arm motions may make it slightly more challenging to understand and learn.<br/>\n<br/>\n    To get started with learning Frostbite, start with a base \n\tpattern of siteswap 44133 with the 4s as outside columns and otherwise \n\tvanilla.

      "description": "     The Half-Box is one of the first tricks jugglers learn \n\tthat includes a horizontal pass (the ball that goes directly between hands). \n\tThe pattern is almost universally known by its siteswap, and thus is usually \n\tjust called the 441. There have been attempts at giving it a name (some have \n\ttried to call it Parallel Schizophrenic), but none of them have stuck. I \n\tthink the name Half-Box matches the trick quite nicely, as it is similar to \n\tthe normal Box, except slower and easier. This is not unlike the Half-Shower \n\tand regular Shower patterns.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tRegardless of the name, learning the Half-Box is fairly simple. Breaking the \n\tpattern down, we can see that there are three main components: a Two-in-One \n\tin the left hand, then a pass, then a Two-in-One in the right hand. Thus, \n\tyou should already be proficient at the Two-in-One in both hands, and also \n\tbe able to do a solid Cascade before attempting this trick.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t   \n\tTo begin practicing, you are going to start with two balls—one in your left \n\tand one in your right. Then, you are going to make one throw straight up (as \n\tif doing a Two-in-One) from your dominant hand, and then right after that \n\tyou are going to make a horizontal pass from your non-dominant hand to your \n\tnow empty dominant hand. Then, you are going to make a second Two-in-One \n\tthrow with that ball you just passed, and then catch the first ball. And \n\tfinally, you are going to pass that first ball to your non-dominant and \n\tcatch the second ball. The balls should end up in a different hand than when \n\tthey started:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim4\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441firststep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tYou are going to want to practice this in each hand, as it is the foundation \n\tof the Half-Box. Once you can reliably perform these throws in both \n\tdirections, you are ready to link them together:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim3\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441secondstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tNow its just a matter of adding the third ball. Start with two balls in your \n\tdominant hand, one ball in the other. Throw one ball from your dominant \n\thand, then throw the ball in your non-dominant hand. Right after you throw \n\tthat second ball, do a horizontal pass from your dominant hand to your \n\tnon-dominant hand, and then stop. You have just done one run of the \n\tHalf-Box:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim2\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441flash.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tAll that's left is just to remove the pause and keep the pattern going. This \n\tcan be done by throwing another Two-in-One throw at the end of the flash, \n\tand just repeating the cycle again:<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"newStyle1\" height=\"165\" id=\"smallanim\" src=\"../../JugglingGifs/3balltricks/441thirdstep.gif\" width=\"165\"/><br/>\n\t   \n\tAnd there you have it. Just keep adding in more and more cycles and \n\teventually you will be able to the Half-Box indefinitely. As the name \n\tsuggests, this trick is perfect for practicing the Box (though I personally \n\tlearned the Box first)but it can also be good training for the Shower \n\tpattern. </p>"

Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does a high non-crossing throw (a 6), and the left hand does a low crossing throw (a 4x). Then the same throws are repeated, but with the left hand throwing a 6 and the right hand throwing a 4x. The high throws should be almost three times as high as the low throws.  The simplest way to transition from a cascade to (6,4x)* is to make two crossing 6 ball height throws from one hand in the cascade: ...5555555555 6x56x1x (6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade, do a pair of (6,4x) throws with the higher throw at 7 ball height (but still not crossing), and then a normal pair of (6,4x) throws: ...(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6) (7x,4x)(4x,6)(1x,5)! 5555555555... (The 7x is a non-crossing 7-height throw, and the (1x,5) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (1x,5) pair.)  Transition animation  You can switch between (6x,4)* and (6,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate throwing two objects to the left and throwing two objects to the right.  Most of the high throws for a 360 in a (6,4x)* pattern are pairs of (8,6x) throws, but for a 3-up or 5-up 360, the first pair of high throws is (8,4x): a 3-up is (8,4x)(6x,8)(2,2), and a 5-up is (8,4x)(6x,8)(8,6x)(0,0).

      "description": "(6x,4)*, short for (6x,4)(4,6x), is the easiest symmetrical synchronous 5 object siteswap. Three balls are juggled in a cascade at 6 ball height, and the other two balls go up and down on the sides of the pattern at 4 ball height. Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does a high crossing throw (a 6x), and the left hand does a low non-crossing throw (a 4). Then the same throws are repeated, but with the left hand throwing a 6x and the right hand throwing a 4. The high throws should be almost three times as high as the low throws.  Video: 5 ball (6x,4)* with the 6s as backcrosses by Daniela Paličková  Video: 5 ring (6x,4)* with the 4s as pancakes by Chris Hodge  Video: 5 club (6x,4)* with the 4s as lazies by Wes Peden  The simplest way to transition from a cascade to (6x,4)* is to make two crossing 6 ball height throws from one hand in the cascade: ...5555555555 6x56x1x (4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade, do a pair of (6x,4) throws with the higher throw at 7 ball height, and then a normal pair of (6x,4) throws: ...(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x) (7,4)(4,6x)(5,1x)! 5555555555... (The (5,1x) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (5,1x) pair.)  Transition animation  You can switch between (6x,4)* and (6,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate throwing two objects to the left and throwing two objects to the right.  Most of the high throws for a 360 in a (6x,4)* pattern are pairs of (8x,6) throws, but for a 3-up or 5-up 360, the first pair of high throws is (8x,4): a 3-up is (8x,4)(6,8x)(2,2), and a 5-up is (8x,4)(6,8x)(8x,6)(0,0). A 4-up 360 can be done with only (8x,6)s, without an (8x,4): (8x,6)(6,8x)(2,0). "

Four balls are juggled in a fountain at 8 ball height, while the other two balls alternate going up and down at 4 ball height. Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does an 8 (twice as high as the 6 ball fountain), and the left hand does a 4 (about a third of the height of the 6 ball fountain). Then in the next pair of throws, the left hand throws an 8 and the right hand throws a 4.

      "description": "A 1-count is a passing pattern where every throw is a pass. Since this is an ambidextrous pattern, it's more difficult than a 2-count. In passing world records, only the number of passes caught is counted, so numbers passing records are commonly done in 1-count patterns because the easier 2-count would have to be done twice as long to get the same number of caught passes.  In a 2-person 1-count with an even number of objects, each person does a pass on every throw while juggling in a cascade or a fountain. This results in two cascades or wimpy patterns each done with one juggler's right hand and the other juggler's left hand. It can be done asynch or synch. In a 6 (or 10, 14, 18) object synch 1-count, the jugglers take turns throwing with both hands at the same time. In an 8 (or 12, 16, 20) object synch 1-count, all four hands throw at the same time.  In an 6 object asynch 1-count, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. In an 8 object asynch 1-count, one juggler's right hand throws at the same time as the other juggler's left hand. Collisions can be avoided in an 8 object 1-count by having one person throw passes on the outside of the pattern and the other person throw passes on the inside of the pattern, or by having one person throw at 5-height and the other person throw at 3-height, with the jugglers taking turns throwing with both hands at the same time.  A 1-count with an odd number of objects can be done with every throw the same height, and only one hand throwing at a time. One person throws diagonal passes, and the other person throws straight passes. Both people juggle at a normal speed, each throwing in between the other's throws. The order the hands throw in depends on the number of objects being juggled. For a number just above a multiple of 4 (5, 9, 13, 17), the throwing order is: diagonal-passer's right hand, straight-passer's right hand, diagonal-passer's left hand, straight-passer's left hand. For a number just below a multiple of 4 (7, 11, 15, 19), the throwing order is: diagonal-passer's right hand, straight-passer's left hand, diagonal-passer's left hand, straight-passer's right hand. The straight-passer does their first throw (a pass) right after the diagonal-passer's first throw. If the diagonal-passer starts with their right hand, the straight-passer's first pass is with their left hand for 7 objects, or their right hand for 9 objects.  A less collision-prone way to do a 1-count with an odd number of objects is to have the diagonal-passer throw higher than the straight-passer. (The two jugglers should throw at the heights of the basic solo patterns for two consecutive numbers that add up to the number of objects being passed, e.g. 3s and 4s for passing 7, or 4s and 5s for passing 9.) In this kind of 1-count, the hands are synchronized: for a number just above a multiple of 4, one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand, and for a number just below a multiple of 4, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. To start the pattern, the diagonal-passer throws one object first, and then the straight-passer makes their first throw at the same time as the diagonal-passer makes their second throw.  The 2-height 1-count can also be done with the straight-passer throwing higher than the diagonal-passer. In this kind of 1-count, for a number just above a multiple of 4, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time, and for a number just below a multiple of 4, one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand. To start the pattern, the straight-passer throws one object first, and then the diagonal-passer makes their first throw at the same time as the straight-passer makes their second throw. "

      "description": "A 2-count is a passing pattern where every other throw is a pass. In a right-handed 2-count all the right-hand throws are passed, and in a left-handed 2-count all the left-hand throws are passed.  In a 2-person 2-count with an even number of objects, each person does a cascade or a wimpy pattern with every right-hand (or left-hand) throw passed to the other person's left (or right) hand. The two jugglers' throws are synchronized, so that both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. If both people are juggling synchronous patterns, all four hands throw at the same time. An 8 (or 12 or 16) object 2-count is normally done synch, but it can also be done asynch by making the passes higher than the other throws, e.g. 8 objects in a 53 pattern (passing the 5s). A 10 (or 14 or 18) object 2-count is normally done asynch, but it can be done synch by making the passes higher than the other throws, e.g. 10 objects in a (6x,4x) pattern.  The 2-count pattern for 7 balls is the same as a 6 ball 2-count except the passes are at 4 ball height instead of 3 ball height, and the hands are synchronized differently: one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand. To start the pattern, the person holding more balls throws one pass first, and then the other person makes their first throw (a pass) at the same time as the first person makes their second throw. 11 or 15 balls are done the same way, but with higher throws: 6s and 5 for 11, and 8s and 7s for 15. A 9 ball 2-count is the same as an 8 ball 2-count except the passes are at 5 ball height instead of 4 ball height, and the hands are synchronized differently: the jugglers take turns throwing with both hands at the same time. Like the 7 ball 2-count, the pattern starts with the person holding more balls throwing one pass first, before the other person starts throwing. 13 or 17 balls are done the same way, but with higher throws: 7s and 6s for 13, and 9s and 8 for 17.

      "description": "A 3-count is an ambidextrous passing pattern where every third throw is a pass. In a 6 object 3-count, the same two objects are passed every time they're thrown. An 8 object 3-count is done by passing every third throw in an async fountain, with one juggler's right hand throwing at the same time as the other juggler's left hand.  A 3-count for odd numbers is similar to a (1-height) 1-count for odd numbers: one person throws diagonal passes, and the other person throws straight passes, and only one hand throws at a time. In a 7 object 3-count, the throws are passed 4.5s and non-passed (crossing) 3s, and in a 9 object 3 count, the throws are passed 5.5s and non-passed (non-crossing) 4s. To start, the diagonal-passer throws one object first, and then the straight-passer does their first throw (a pass) right after the diagonal-passer's second throw. If the diagonal-passer starts with their right hand, the straight-passer's first pass is with their left hand for 7 objects, or their right hand for 9 objects. "

      "description": "A 4-count (also called \"every others\") is a passing pattern where every fourth throw is a pass. This is a common pattern for passing 6 objects, with two people doing cascades and passing on every other right-hand throw. With 8 objects it can be done either entirely in the wimpy pattern, alternating between throwing a right hand pass and a left hand crossing throw, and then two crossing throws, or the two throws between passes can be non-crossing, so the pattern alternates between two throws of a wimpy pattern with one hand throwing to the other person, and two throws of a synch fountain. The second method is the one that would be used for rings and clubs since those props are not good for wimpy patterns.  A 4-count for an odd number of objects is the same as a 4-count for the even number just below that number (including the way the hands are synchronized) except the passes are higher than the other throws (e.g. passed 5s and non-passed 3s for 7 objects, or passed 6s and non-passed 4s for 9 objects), and the two jugglers don't pass at the same time: one person's right hand throws a pass at the same time as the other person's right hand throws a non-passed throw. To start the pattern, the person holding more objects starts juggling by throwing a pass, and the other person makes their first throw (a pass) at the same time as the first person makes their third throw.

      "description": "A 6-count is a passing pattern where every sixth throw is a pass. Beginning passers usually start passing 6 objects in a 6-count pattern. The same two objects are passed every time they're thrown with the right hands (assuming the pattern is done right-handed). With 8 objects it can be done either entirely in the wimpy pattern, alternating between throwing a right hand pass and a left hand crossing throw, and then two pairs of crossing throws, or the two pairs of synch throws between passes can be non-crossing, so the pattern alternates between two throws of a wimpy pattern with one hand throwing to the other person, and four throws of a synch fountain. The second method is the one that would be used for rings and clubs since those props are not good for wimpy patterns.  In a 6-count with an odd number, each person alternates between doing three throws of the basic asynch solo patterns for two different numbers that add up to the number of objects being used in the passing pattern. A 7 ball 6-count alternates between three 4 ball throws and three 3 ball throws, and a 9 ball 6-count alternates between three 5 ball throws and three 4 ball throws. Each time one of the jugglers does a set of three higher throws, the last of the three throws is a pass (a straight pass if it's at an even-number height, e.g. a 4 in a 7 ball pattern, and a diagonal pass if it's at an odd-number height, e.g. a 5 in a 9 ball pattern). To start the pattern, the person holding more objects starts juggling by doing three high throws (the last of which is a pass), and then the other person makes their first throw (also starting with three high throws) at the same time as the first person makes their fourth throw.

There is one object that is always thrown with the right hand, and one that is always thrown with the left hand.

Then the left hand throws the second object, catches the first object, and passes it back over to the right hand before the second object is caught, and the pattern repeats.  This is an excited state siteswap, starting in the state 101.
