For the multi-person trick, see "" Steals "".   Burke's barrage is a 3 ball trick invented by Ken Burke . This pattern is a variation of ""real tennis "" ( 423 with the 3s thrown over the top of the pattern). In Burke's barrage, the 4s (non-crossing throws) are thrown under the arm , and the 3s (crossing throws) are caught under the arm. The 4s should be caught using claw catches. Another way to describe the pattern is as a 423  Mills mess where the 4s are thrown under the arm. Variations Edit      Takeouts or Charlie's cheat is a variation where after a 4 is caught, that ball is carried over the top of the pattern. This is how Burke's barrage was described in the first edition of Charlie Dancey's  Encyclopædia of Ball Juggling . (The way Ken Burke originally did it, that ball is carried through the middle of the pattern, going under the 4 that was thrown next.)    Luke Burrage invented a 5 ball multiplex trick called "" Burke's Burrage "" that combines the original Burke's barrage with the ""takeouts"" variation.    Reverse Burke's barrage      ""Box barrage"" ( Luke's shuffle with switched columns ) is a box variation that is just like Burke's barrage, except it's a synchronous pattern.

Squeezes can be much more difficult than multiplex throws, because the objects have to be thrown just right so that they land very close together. A squeeze catch can occur in a siteswap when a throw of value N is followed M beats later by a throw of value (N - M), with both throws directed to the same hand - for example, a 4 and a 4x thrown from different hands at the same time, or a 3 thrown right after a 4, or a 7 with a 5 two beats after it. In vanilla siteswap, patterns with collisions like this are invalid, but it's possible to write valid patterns with squeezes using multiplex notation, by writing the next throw made by the hand that did the squeeze catch as a multiplex throw involving the same number of objects that were just caught by that hand. (This ""multiplex throw"" can include a 2, which would usually mean that one of the objects stays in that hand while others are thrown, so it may not be an actual multiplex throw.) The time-reverse of 5 ball splits - ([44x],2)* - is the squeeze pattern ([42],4x)*, where the 4 from one hand and the 4x from the other hand land at the same time in the hand that threw the 4. Siteswaps like this can also be done without using actual squeeze catches, by throwing the objects to slightly different heights so that they don't land at the same time. Clustered patterns like [33], [44], and [55] are normally done with the stacked throws staggered so that the objects are caught one at a time.

One-handed juggling is normally done in a "" rolling out "" pattern, so the objects go in an arc to the right (clockwise) if the right hand is being used, and to the left (counter-clockwise) if the left hand is being used. Other one-handed patterns include "" rolling in "" (where the objects go in an arc in the opposite direction), columns , and patterns with the same shape as two-handed patterns, such as a one-handed 3 ball  cascade . One-handed juggling is the foundation of the most common method for juggling an even number of objects in two hands: the fountain pattern, where two one-handed patterns are done at the same time, with each hand juggling the same number of objects. A pseudohalfshower is also two one-handed patterns done at the same time, but with a different number of objects in each hand. A basic one-handed pattern is written in siteswap notation as an even number (twice the number of objects used) followed by a 0. Vanilla siteswaps can be interpreted as one-handed patterns. Each number represents the kind of throw you would do if you were juggling that number of objects in one hand. A 0 is a beat with an empty hand, and a 1 is a pause with an object held in the hand. You can write a one-handed interpretation of a siteswap in two-handed notation by replacing each number with the siteswap for juggling that number of objects in one hand. The one-handed version of 423 written in two-handed siteswap is 804060 . Siteswaps can also be done in shower and diabolo patterns in a similar way.

4-count,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/1/18/5_4count_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/4-count,"         A 4-count (also called ""every others"") is a passing pattern where every fourth throw is a pass. This is a common pattern for passing 6 objects, with two people doing cascades and passing on every other right-hand throw. With 8 objects it can be done either entirely in the wimpy pattern , alternating between throwing a right hand pass and a left hand crossing throw, and then two crossing throws, or the two throws between passes can be non-crossing, so the pattern alternates between two throws of a wimpy pattern with one hand throwing to the other person, and two throws of a synch fountain . The second method is the one that would be used for rings and clubs since those props are not good for wimpy patterns. A 4-count for an odd number of objects is the same as a 4-count for the even number just below that number (including the way the hands are synchronized) except the passes are higher than the other throws (e.g. passed 5s and non-passed 3s for 7 objects, or passed 6s and non-passed 4s for 9 objects), and the two jugglers don't pass at the same time: one person's right hand throws a pass at the same time as the other person's right hand throws a non-passed throw. To start the pattern, the person holding more objects starts juggling by throwing a pass, and the other person makes their first throw (a pass) at the same time as the first person makes their third throw.     5 ball 4-count <(2x,4xp)|(2x,2x)><(2x,2x)|(2x,4xp)>   6 ball 4-count <3p|3p><3|3><3|3><3|3>   7 ball 4-count <5p|3><3|3><3|5p><3|3>     8 ball 4-count <(4x,4xp)|(4x,4xp)><(4,4)|(4,4)>   9 ball 4-count <(4x,6xp)|(4,4)><(4,4)|(4x,6xp)>   10 ball 4-count <5p|5p><5|5><5|5><5|5>     See also Edit  1-count  2-count  3-count  6-count     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/4-count?oldid=19659 ""     "

Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does a high non-crossing throw (a 6), and the left hand does a low crossing throw (a 4x). Then the same throws are repeated, but with the left hand throwing a 6 and the right hand throwing a 4x. The high throws should be almost three times as high as the low throws. The simplest way to transition from a cascade to (6,4x)* is to make two crossing 6 ball height throws from one hand in the cascade : ...5555555555 6x56x1x (6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade , do a pair of (6,4x) throws with the higher throw at 7 ball height (but still not crossing), and then a normal pair of (6,4x) throws: ...(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6)(6,4x)(4x,6) (7x,4x)(4x,6)(1x,5)! 5555555555... (The 7x is a non-crossing 7-height throw, and the (1x,5) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (1x,5) pair.)   Transition animation   You can switch between (6x,4)* and (6,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate throwing two objects to the left and throwing two objects to the right. Most of the high throws for a 360 in a (6,4x)* pattern are pairs of (8,6x) throws, but for a 3-up or 5-up 360 , the first pair of high throws is (8,4x): a 3-up is (8,4x)(6x,8)(2,2) , and a 5-up is (8,4x)(6x,8)(8,6x)(0,0) . A 4-up 360 can be done with only (8,6x)s , without an (8,4x): (8,6x)(6x,8)(0,2) .

Five-handed_patterns,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/c/c3/6_in_5_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Five-handed_patterns,"         Five-handed patterns can be done by passing between three people, with two of them using both hands and the other only using one hand, by passing between between four people, with one of them using both hands and the others each using one hand, or by passing between five people, with each of them only using one hand. There are five basic patterns for five-handed passing. In the patterns described below, every throw is the same height, the throws are continually made by the five hands in a certain order on an even rhythm, and each hand always throws to the next hand to the right, so the objects are slowly moving counter-clockwise as viewed from above.  For a number of objects that is one more than a multiple of five (6, 11, 16...): The order the hands throw in is counter-clockwise. Each throw is made by the next hand to the right of the hand that made the previous throw. For a number of objects that is two more than a multiple of five (7, 12, 17...): Each throw is made by the hand that is two hands to the left of the hand that made the previous throw. For a number of objects that is two less than a multiple of five (8, 13, 18...): Each throw is made by the hand that is two hands to the right of the hand that made the previous throw.

This throw goes down through the pattern diagonally and is caught (usually in the opposite hand) in the normal position, below the last object thrown from the hand that catches it. A reverse slam is made from a normal position, going under the next object that will be caught by the hand doing the reverse slam. It goes up through the pattern diagonally and is caught above the last object thrown from the hand that catches it. Slams are most commonly done in patterns where they have a siteswap value of 2x, but they can also be done as 1s, 2s, or 3s. The shuffle is a shower pattern done with slams, and Luke's shuffle (invented by Luke Gravett ) is a box done with slams. The slow shuffle and the Boston shuffle are easier versions of these tricks, where instead of doing slams on every beat, the slams are separated by a beat where you just do a basic crossing throw. The N-box is a box where you alternate doing slams and reverse slams.

Shuffle_(diabolo),,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Shuffle_(diabolo),"         For the shower variation, see Slam .   The shuffle is a basic pattern for juggling multiple diabolos . The diabolos are pushed off the string from one side of the pattern so they go over the other diabolos, then caught on the string on the other side and pushed back over to the throwing side of the string, so they go around in a low circle. Another way to juggle multiple diabolos besides the shuffle is in a high pattern, where the diabolos are thrown higher, one at a time, and there is never more than one on the string at once, as opposed to the low pattern (the shuffle), where there can be more than one diabolo on the string at the same time. 5 is the highest number of diabolos that have been qualified in the low pattern, and 6 is the highest number that have been done for at least a flash .      5 Diabolos 135 catches World Record !!  5 diabolo shuffle by Liao Wang      Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Shuffle_(diabolo)?oldid=21641 ""     "

The jugglers stand in two straight lines, with the people in each line facing toward the other line. The lines of jugglers are staggered so that no one is standing directly in front of someone else. Except for the two people farthest from the center of this formation, each person juggles like they would if they were the feeder in a 3-person feed : They pass with the two people in front of them, alternately throwing to the left and to the right. Every time the feeders pass, either all of them throw to their left or all of them throw to their right. The two people at the ends each have only one person to pass to, so they juggle like the feedees in a 3-person feed. If the feeders are doing 2-counts , the people at the ends do 4-counts . In an extended feed with an even number of people, the two people at the ends pass at the same time. In an extended feed with an odd number of people, the people at the ends juggle out of time with each other like the feedees in a 3-person feed: Whenever one of them is passing to a feeder, the other one is doing a self throw.      4-person extended feed (also called an N-feed)  5-person extended feed (also called a W -feed)   6-person extended feed       SJRI 9p Extended Feed  9 person extended feed      Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Extended_feed?oldid=12105 ""     "

Both hands throw at the same time, and each object is thrown at an angle, moving across from one hand to the other. All the objects are thrown to about the same height. The basic synch crossing pattern is called the ""wimpy pattern"" because it's easier than the standard fountain pattern for juggling high even numbers of balls . Collisions can be avoided by throwing slightly higher with one hand, by throwing with one hand farther forward than the other, by making the throws not quite synchronous, or by just aiming to try to make the balls collide. The wimpy pattern with rings or clubs is more difficult than a fountain because those props are too big to easily avoid collisions. It's easier to do a reverse wimpy pattern with the rings or clubs turned sideways than to do a wimpy pattern with normal inside throws with those props. A wimpy pattern is written in siteswap notation as two of the same even number, inside parentheses and separated with a comma, with an ""x"" after each number. The wimpy pattern is the most common way to juggle an even number of props in bounce juggling and one-sided overhead throws . The highest number of objects that have been qualified (at least twice as many catches as objects) in the wimpy pattern is 10 balls (for both toss juggling and bounce juggling ), and the highest number of objects that have been flashed (same number of throws and catches as objects) in the wimpy pattern is 12 balls (for both toss juggling and bounce juggling).

The pattern is a repeating sequence of three throws, alternately starting with the right hand and the left hand:  The first throw is made under the arm . The arms stay crossed so that the next catch made by the hand doing that throw is also done under the arm. The second throw is made under the arm, after uncrossing the arms and re-crossing them the other way. The third throw is an outside throw . Rick Rubenstein does this throw as a penguin throw (a reverse penguin catch). The next catch done by the hand making this throw should be clawed .

He came up with that name because he wanted to have an alliterative trick (like Mills mess , Burke's barrage , Rubenstein's revenge , etc.) named after himself. When he wrote the Encyclopædia of Ball Juggling he included an entry for Dancey's devilment, but he never actually invented a trick to go with it. In his book, Charlie Dancey claims that the trick came to him in a dream, but when he woke up he couldn't remember exactly what it was. He describes the trick as ""a four or five ball pattern with the looping features of Rubenstein's revenge combined with multiplex throws of varying kinds"". The illustration shows a juggler throwing a split multiplex under the arm with one hand, while the other hand does an orbiting motion. Several versions of the trick have been invented by different people based on the description in the Encyclopædia.

In a box with switched columns , the right hand throws a ball in a column on the left side of the pattern, and the left hand throws a ball in a column on the right side. In a box with "" switched zips "", the ball that zips back and forth between the hands moves in the direction corresponding to the hand throwing the zip, instead of the direction of the hand that will catch it. A zip going from the right hand to the left hand goes from the left side of the pattern to the right side and vice-versa, so to catch the zips in the right position the hands have to keep moving to the other side of the pattern after throwing a column ball, and then back to the other side to catch the column. In both of these box variations, both hands throw and catch on the same side of the pattern at the same time. It's also possible to do the box with both the columns and the zips switched. In this pattern, a completely ""switched"" box, the hands are always on opposite sides of the pattern while they're throwing and catching, like in a normal box, but with the arms crossed , so all the throws and catches on the right side of the pattern are made by the left hand and vice-versa. In a normal box, a full switched box, an upside-down box with switched columns, an upside-down box with switched zips, or a true box , the balls stay away from each other so that they are always in different corners of the box. In a box with switched columns, a box with switched zips, an upside-down box, or a full switched upside-down box, two balls come together in the same corner of the box on each beat, while the other ball is in the opposite corner.

Each feedee throws with the right hand while the feeder is throwing with the left hand and vice versa. The feeder does a 2-count , throwing passed 4s and self 3s. Whenever the feeder passes to a feedee, that feedee passes a 4 to the feeder on the next beat.  Since a feedee doesn't have to pass until after they see the feeder pass, the feedees don't have to know in advance when the feeder is going to pass to them, so the feeder can pass to them in a random order.

Lid,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/9/94/42x_lids_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Lid,"         A lid is a quick short throw (i.e. a pass/zip/feed - a 1 or 2x in siteswap ) that goes over the top of the whole pattern. It is thrown straight across the top of the patttern, going over both the next object that will be caught by the hand that throws the lid, and the last object thrown from the hand that catches it. A box done with lids is called an upside-down box or an inverted box , because it still has the shape of a box, but turned upside-down.

Three-handed_patterns,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/8/83/4_in_3_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Three-handed_patterns,"         Three-handed patterns can be done by passing between two people, with one of them using both hands and the other only using one hand, or by passing between three people, with each of them only using one hand. There are three basic patterns you can use, depending on how many objects you're juggling. In these patterns every throw should be the same height, and each hand always throws to the next hand to the right (or each hand always throws to the next hand to the left if you decide to do it in the other direction), so if one person is using both hands and passing right-handed, the objects go around in a circle counter-clockwise.  For a number of objects that is one more than a multiple of three (4, 7, 10...): One hand throws at a time, and the order of the hands is the same as the direction the objects are going. If the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is counter-clockwise (left hand, right hand, partner's hand). For a number of objects that is one less than a multiple of three (5, 8, 11...): One hand throws at a time, and the order of the hands is the opposite of the direction the objects are going. If the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is clockwise (right hand, left hand, partner's hand). For a number of objects that is a multiple of three (6, 9, 12...): All three hands throw at the same time.     4 balls in 3 hands (a domino pattern )   5 balls in 3 hands   6 balls in 3 hands   Siteswaps Edit  Vanilla siteswaps can be interpreted as three-handed patterns. If you do a siteswap with the hands throwing in a counter-clockwise order, any number that is one more than a multiple of three is a throw that goes to the next hand to the right, any number that is one less than a multiple of three is a throw that goes to the next hand to the left, and any number that is a multiple of three is a throw that comes back to the same hand that threw it. A 0 is a beat with an empty hand, a 1 or a 2 is an object handed straight into another hand, a 3 is a pause with an object held in the hand, and any higher number should be thrown to the same height you would throw if you were doing the basic three-handed pattern for that number of objects at the same speed you're doing the siteswap.     552    744    64    See also Edit  One-handed patterns  Five-handed patterns     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Three-handed_patterns?oldid=19489 ""     "

The balls don't stay in the same columns - when a ball is caught, it's usually moved to a different column. The throws are made alternately with the right and left hands. Three throws are made in two columns on the right side of the pattern, starting with the left hand, and then three throws are made in two columns on the left side of the pattern, starting with the right hand. The first two throws in each of these sets of three are active 2s, so they quickly bounce right back into the same hands that threw them. The last throw made before moving to the other side of the pattern is a 5, which bounces twice before it's caught. The second 2 thrown after a 5 should bounce at the same time as the 5 does its second bounce.    Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Dyer%27s_straights?oldid=19459 ""     "

Video : 65 variations of (4x,2)* with active 2s  Synonyms for other basic patterns Edit  The 4 ball asynch fountain can be written with a maximum throw value of 8 as:  4  (6,2)*  822  (8,0)*   The 4 ball synch fountain can be written with a maximum throw value of 8 as:  (4,4)  (6,6)(2,2)  (8,8)(2,2)(2,2)  (8,8)(0,0)   The 5 ball cascade can only be written two ways without exceeding a throw value of 9: 5 and (8x,2)* . Other ways to write this pattern using higher throws include:  (ax,0)*  b22  d20  (ex,2)(2,2)*  f00  (gx,2)(0,2)*  h2222  (kx,0)(0,0)*   Repetitions, rotations, and reflections Edit  A siteswap can also be written in different ways by repeating the sequence of numbers: 744 , 744744, 744744744, etc. all represent the same pattern, but a siteswap pattern is normally expressed in the shortest possible form (no repetition). Patterns containing more than one throw height, such as ""...123451234512345..."", can be written several different ways without repetition, since a variety of starting points are possible for the notation. 12345 , 23451, 34512, 45123, and 51234 all represent the same pattern, since they all look the same when written as an indefinitely repeating sequence. Switching the numbers in each pair of throws in a synchronous pattern, for example changing (6x,4)(2,4x) to (4,6x)(4x,2), results in another way of writing the same pattern. If you consider the number to the left of a comma to always be a left hand throw (or if you consider the number to the left of a comma to always be a right hand throw), then the new notation represents the mirror-image version of the original pattern.  Synch, asynch, and one-handed patterns Edit  A shower pattern can be written either in asynchronous notation or in synchronous notation. There is not much difference between the asynch patterns 51 , 71 , 91 , and the synch patterns (4x,2x) , (6x,2x) , (8x,2x) , and in practice the shower is commonly done with a rhythm in between synch and asynch. (Jugglers usually use a high dwell time , which makes it impossible to do 1s with a perfect asynch rhythm.) Sprung patterns , which are normally written in synchronous notation, can also be written as asynch patterns ( e.g. 612 instead of (4,2x)* and 912 instead of (6x,2x)* ). One-handed patterns are exactly the same whether they're written in asynch notation or in synch notation since one hand isn't doing anything, so there are no throws to be synchronized. If the 0 in the siteswap for a one-handed pattern is replaced with a 2, there is still no difference in the pattern except that the hand that isn't juggling is now holding an object. So 2 in 1 hand can be written as 40 , (4,0) , 42 , or (4,2) , 3 in 1 hand can be written as 60 , (6,0) , 62 , or (6,2) , and 4 in 1 hand can be written as 80 , (8,0) , 82 , or (8,2) .      42 ~ Three Ball Siteswap  3 ball 42 by Robert Wood      Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Siteswap_synonyms?oldid=20137 ""     "

Those names usually refer to a 5 object trick, but similar patterns can be done with other numbers. In the Gattoplex, one hand throws a split multiplex, then the same hand throws just one prop , and then the same throws are repeated on the other side. In a pattern with an odd number of objects the non-multiplex throw is a self throw, and in a pattern with an even number of objects it's a crossing throw.

The normal factory is an asymmetrical pattern that repeats every three beats:  The right hand throws a ball straight up, while the left hand carries a ball up to the top of the pattern on the left side, synchronized with the ball on the right. The right hand throws another ball straight up, to the left of the last ball it threw, while the left hand carries the ball it's holding horizontally across the top of the pattern, crossing over to the right side of the pattern. The right hand throws another ball straight up, to the right of the last ball it threw, while the left hand (which should now be farther to the right than the right hand) drops the ball it's been holding down to be caught in the right hand, and then quickly moves back to the left side of the pattern to claw the ball that was thrown on beat 2.  Make sure your hand stops moving horizontally before you drop the ball, so it will fall straight down.  Alternative names Edit  Machine Robot Droppings  Variations Edit  Alternating factory: Do the same three beats described above, but alternate doing the right-handed version and the left-handed version. Reverse factory Relf's factory  Cross-armed factory  2-beat factory (the pendulum ): The right hand throws a ball straight up on the left side of the pattern, while the left hand carries the ball it's holding horizontally across the top of the pattern, crossing over to the right side of the pattern. The right hand throws another ball straight up, to the right of the last ball it threw, while the left hand (which is now farther to the right than the right hand) drops the ball it's been holding down to be caught in the right hand, and then quickly moves back to the left side of the pattern to claw the ball that was thrown on beat 1.  1-beat factory (the waterfall ): The right hand throws a ball up to the left side of the pattern, while the left hand carries the ball it's holding horizontally across the top of the pattern, crossing over to the right side of the pattern, drops the ball down to be caught in the right hand, and then quickly moves back to the left side of the pattern to claw the ball that was thrown from the right hand. This is easiest when done in an asynch pattern ( siteswap  3 ) with two distinct ""beats"": throw and carry, then drop and claw. The waterfall is not always done with claw catches.

Koblikov 10 balls pirouette !!!  10 ball stacked 10 up 360 by Alexander Koblikov     A stack is a multiplex throw where all the objects are thrown to the same hand (not necessarily the same hand that threw them), typically done so that the objects are ""stacked"" vertically in the air. In a self stack, all the objects return to the hand that threw them, and in a crossing stack, all the objects cross over to the other hand. A clustered multiplex is a stacked throw where all the objects being thrown are treated as one object, so they will all be gathered into one hand before any of them is thrown again. A clustered duplex is written in siteswap notation using two of the same number ( e.g. [33], [44], [55] ). A non-multiplex pattern can be made into a multiplex pattern using twice as many objects by making every throw a duplex cluster. Any composite number of objects can be juggled in a multiplex pattern similar to a basic non-multiplex pattern by throwing the same kind of clustered stack for every throw. A cut multiplex is a stack where one of the objects is caught and thrown again before catching any other objects that were part of that throw.

2-count,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/1/1e/5_2count_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/2-count,"         A 2-count is a passing pattern where every other throw is a pass. In a right-handed 2-count all the right-hand throws are passed, and in a left-handed 2-count all the left-hand throws are passed. In a 2-person 2-count with an even number of objects, each person does a cascade or a wimpy pattern with every right-hand (or left-hand) throw passed to the other person's left (or right) hand. The two jugglers' throws are synchronized, so that both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. If both people are juggling synchronous patterns, all four hands throw at the same time. An 8 (or 12 or 16) object 2-count is normally done synch, but it can also be done asynch by making the passes higher than the other throws, e.g. 8 objects in a 53 pattern (passing the 5s). A 10 (or 14 or 18) object 2-count is normally done asynch, but it can be done synch by making the passes higher than the other throws, e.g. 10 objects in a (6x,4x) pattern. The 2-count pattern for 7 balls is the same as a 6 ball 2-count except the passes are at 4 ball height instead of 3 ball height, and the hands are synchronized differently: one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand. To start the pattern, the person holding more balls throws one pass first, and then the other person makes their first throw (a pass) at the same time as the first person makes their second throw. 11 or 15 balls are done the same way, but with higher throws: 6s and 5 for 11, and 8s and 7s for 15. A 9 ball 2-count is the same as an 8 ball 2-count except the passes are at 5 ball height instead of 4 ball height, and the hands are synchronized differently: the jugglers take turns throwing with both hands at the same time. Like the 7 ball 2-count, the pattern starts with the person holding more balls throwing one pass first, before the other person starts throwing. 13 or 17 balls are done the same way, but with higher throws: 7s and 6s for 13, and 9s and 8 for 17.     5 ball asynch 2-count <(4x,2)|(2,2)><(2,4xp)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(4x,2)><(2,2)|(2,4xp)>   5 ball synch 2-count <(3p,2x)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3p,2x)!>   6 ball asynch 2-count <3p|3p><3|3>     6 ball synch 2-count <(2x,4xp)|(2x,4xp)>   7 ball 2-count <R|L><4xp|3><3|4xp>   8 ball synch 2-count <(4x,4xp)|(4x,4xp)>     8 ball asynch 2-count <5p|5p><3|3>   9 ball synch 2-count <(5p,4x)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(5p,4x)!>   9 ball asynch 2-count <R|L><6xp|3><3|6xp>     10 ball asynch 2-count <5p|5p><5|5>   10 ball synch 2-count <(4x,6xp)|(4x,6xp)>   9 ball triangle 2-count <3p|3p|3p><3|3|3>         14 Balls 199 Catches  14 ball 2-count by Chris and Andrew Hodge    Alternative names Edit  Solids Everys (because every right-hand (or left-hand) throw is a pass) Shower  See also Edit  1-count  3-count  4-count  6-count     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/2-count?oldid=19657 ""     "

Eric's_extension,,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Eric's_extension,"         Eric's extension is a Mills mess variation invented by Eric Uhrhane . Instead of changing direction every 3 throws like the normal Mills mess, this pattern changes direction every 5 throws. After a normal under the arm throw, the arms keep moving around each other in the same direction so that they cross again, wrapping all the way around each other so the right hand is to the right of the left hand again while the arms are crossed. The next throw is different kind of under the arm throw: if it's a right hand throw, the right hand is reaching under the left arm from left to right instead of from right to left. After that throw, the pattern changes direction in the same way as Mills mess, except the arms are still crossed twice. The arms stay wrapped around until the hand that just threw makes its next catch in the same position, and then during the next throw the arms start uncrossing.

The siteswap notation for an asynch pseudoshower has even-number throws alternating with 1s and an odd period, instead of having odd-number throws alternating with 1s and an even period like a shower. One hand keeps making high non-crossing throws while the other hand passes objects to it, until the throwing hand has thrown all but one object, and then the pattern changes direction so that the other hand throws high. Any given even number can be used in a siteswap pattern to make two different asynch pseudoshowers: in a superior pseudoshower , the siteswap sequence starts and ends with the even number (e.g. 61616 ), so there are two high throws in a row when the pattern is done continuously, and in an inferior pseudoshower , the sequence starts and ends with a 1 (e.g. 16161 ), so there are two 1s in a row when the pattern is done continuously. A superior pseudoshower is done with one more object than the inferior pseudoshower that uses the same even-number throw.      3 ball superior pseudoshower Siteswap: 414       3 ball inferior pseudoshower Siteswap: 16161      4 ball superior pseudoshower Siteswap: 61616      4 ball inferior pseudoshower Siteswap: 1818181      5 ball superior pseudoshower Siteswap: 8181818      5 ball inferior pseudoshower Siteswap: 1a1a1a1a1   A synch pseudoshower is a kind of box pattern, where one hand throws all but two objects high before the pattern changes direction.      3 ball synch pseudoshower Siteswap: (4,2x)*       4 ball synch pseudoshower Siteswap: (6,2x)(6,2x)*      5 ball synch pseudoshower Siteswap: (8,2x)(8,2x)(8,2x)*   Siteswap exercises Edit  You can use these exercises to practice the same kinds of throws and sequences of throws that are done in pseudoshower patterns, before you learn the full pattern.

Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does an 8x (twice as high as the 6 ball fountain), and the left hand does a 4x (about a third of the height of the 6 ball fountain). Then in the next pair of throws, the left hand throws an 8x and the right hand throws a 4x. The 8xs should be around 5 times as high as the 4xs, and each 8x should peak at the same time as the next 4x thrown by the same hand.   Video : 100 catches of 6 ball (8x,4x)* by Paweł Witczak    Video : 6 ball (8x,4x)* with the 4s blind behind the back by Łukasz Uczkiewicz   This is an excited state siteswap, so you can't go directly into it from the basic pattern . To transition from a synch fountain to (8x,4x)*, throw an 8x from one hand while throwing a 6x from the other hand, and then start the (8x,4x)* pattern by throwing the 8x with the hand that did the 6x in the pair of transition throws: ...(6,6)(6,6)(6,6) (8x,6x) (4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x)... To transition back to the fountain, make a high throw from one hand and a low throw (a 4x) from the other hand, throwing high with the same hand that would throw high if you were continuing the (8x,4x)* pattern, but do the high throw at 6 ball height instead of 8 ball height: ...(4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x)(4x,8x)(8x,4x) (4x,6x) (6,6)(6,6)(6,6)...   Transition animation   You can switch between (8,4)* and (8x,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate making a high throw that goes to the left and making a high throw that goes to the right. To do a 360 in (8x,4x)*, you have to start the high throws with (ax,4x)(4x,ax) instead of (ax,6x)(6x,ax) to keep the lower of the high throws from coming down too soon. The rest of the high throws are (ax,6x) pairs. A 4 up is (ax,4x)(4x,ax)(ax,6x)(2,2) , and a 6 up is (ax,4x)(4x,ax)(ax,6x)(6x,ax)(0,0) .

The throwing rhythm is right-pause-right-left-pause-left... with a 1-beat pause between throws with the same hand. Two balls are thrown with non-crossing throws like the throws in a 4 ball fountain (4s), one staying on each side of the pattern, and the other ball is thrown across from hand to hand (3s), about half the height of the non-crossing throws. The 2 is a pause between a 4 and a 3 with the same hand, where the other hand is just holding a ball and not throwing.

For other kinds of throws that go around part of the body, see Category: Body moves .   Body throws are throws that go between the legs while both feet stay on the ground. This trick was invented by Morris Cronin and is most commonly done with 3 clubs in single  spins , with the clubs going between the legs from front to back. For a normal front-to-back body throw, a club starts in front of the juggler, and is brought back between the legs and thrown from this position behind the juggler, and then it comes forward over the opposite shoulder and is caught in front of the juggler. In a back-to-front body throw, a club is brought behind the back, thrown between the legs from back to front, and caught in front with the opposite hand. These throws are often called ""reverse body throws"", but they're not actually time-reversed body throws - a front-to-back body throw in reverse would be something like a blind catch .      5 Club 3up Crotch Throw 360 Extra  3 and 5 club body throw tricks by David Ferman    World records Edit  Body throw world records with publicly available video evidence: Front-to-back body throws   3 balls : 12 catches by Malthe Jerup in 2012 ( video ) 3 rings : 6 catches by Delaney Bayles in 2018 ( video ) 3 clubs: 4 minutes and 33 seconds by Ameron Rosvall in 2013 ( video ) 4 clubs: 8 catches by Kenny Cheung in 2016 ( video ) 5 clubs: 19 catches by Masahiro Takahashi in 2016 ( video )  Back-to-front body throws   3 balls: 26 catches by Kenny Cheung in 2016 ( video ) 3 clubs: 1 minute and 52 seconds by Ameron Rosvall in 2011 ( video ) 4 clubs: 4 catches by Anthony Gatto in 2005 ( video ), Ameron Rosvall in 2010 ( video ), and Kenny Cheung in 2018 ( video ) 5 clubs: 5 catches by Anthony Gatto in 2006 ( video at 58:55)  Unverified claims:  3 clubs: 499 catches by Ameron Rosvall in 2012 ( claim )  Alternative names Edit  Kit Summers named this trick after Albert Lucas in his 1987 book Juggling with Finesse , because Albert was the first person he had seen doing that trick. He called front-to-back body throws Alberts , and back-to-front body throws Treblas . (""Trebla"" is ""Albert"" spelled backwards.) In 2000 Jason Garfield , who disapproved of people giving Albert credit for a trick he didn't invent, introduced a new name for the trick, crotch throws , and later the euphemism body throws (which is an ambiguous name since some jugglers use the term ""body throws"" more generally, for any kinds of trick throws that go around some part of the body). Between the leg throws is a longer, but more descriptive and less ambiguous name than ""body throws"". A less common name for body throws is butterflies .  Variations Edit  Crotch madness - Every third throw is a back-to-front crotch throw, and the rest are front-to-back.

Boston_mess,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/3/3a/3_reachovers_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Boston_mess,"         The Boston mess is a pattern where the arms cross and uncross like in Mills mess , but the three balls go straight up and down in three separate columns .    Half Boston mess reaching over the arm Half Boston mess reaching under the arm    3 ball full Boston mess 4 ball Boston mess  Start with two balls in your right hand and one in your left hand. Throw the first two balls straight up, one from the right hand and then one the left hand, and cross your arms so you can catch the ball on the right with your left hand, on the right side of the pattern. With your arms still crossed, throw the next ball from your right hand straight up through the middle of the pattern, and catch the ball on the left with your right hand, on the left side of the pattern. Now throw the right-column and left-column balls straight up again, but since your arms are still crossed, this time you throw the ball on the right with your left hand, and the ball on the left with your right hand. Uncross your arms so you can catch the ball on the right with your right hand, throw the middle ball straight up with your left hand, and catch the ball on the left in your left hand. Then you can repeat the pattern. This is a half Boston mess, which can be done two different ways: when you cross your arms, your left arm can go either over your right arm, or under it. To do the full Boston mess, alternate crossing your left arm over and under your right arm. This results in a 12-beat pattern:  Right hand throws in right column & (unless you're just starting the pattern) catches in middle column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arm on top Right hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arm underneath Left hand throws in right column & catches in middle column with arm on top Right hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arms uncrossed Right hand throws in right column & catches in middle column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arm underneath Right hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arm on top Left hand throws in right column & catches in middle column with arm underneath Right hand throws in left column & catches in right column with arms uncrossed Left hand throws in middle column & catches in left column with arms uncrossed (return to top of list)  This is not a symmetrical pattern - the throws keep going through the columns from left to right: right-left-middle-right-left-middle-right-left-middle-right... Doing a Boston mess with right and left reversed (follow all the instructions above replacing right with left and left with right) is the same as doing the time-reversed version of the pattern.

Triples,,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Triples,"         Triple rotations or triples are throws where each club  rotates three times before being caught. The basic patterns for 6 and 7 clubs are normally done with triple rotations. A few jugglers also use triples for 8 clubs, which are more commonly done with quads . 720s with 3 clubs and 360s with 4 and 5 clubs are normally done with triples for the high throws. Juggling with 3, 4, or 5 clubs in triple rotations is a more difficult trick than the basic patterns, which are normally done with singles for 3 clubs and doubles for 4 and 5. Those numbers can be done with triples at their normal heights, using fast spins , or in a higher, slower pattern, with the same kinds of throws used in a 6 or 7 club pattern. High triples with lower numbers can be used as an exercise to prepare for learning 6 or 7 clubs.

Domino_pattern,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/7/7e/40_out_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Domino_pattern,"         A domino pattern is a type of juggling pattern where the number of objects used is one more than the number of hands used, and one hand throws at a time. Whenever an object has been thrown to any of the hands, that hand throws the object it's been holding to the next hand before catching the object that was just thrown to it. This makes a chain reaction of throws, and when all the hands have thrown, the object thrown from the last hand goes back to the first hand, starting the pattern over.    A 1-handed domino pattern is a 2 in one hand pattern. A 2-handed domino pattern is a 3 ball  cascade .

It can be done in any 2-handed period 2 crossing siteswap that isn't a shower . If one hand throws higher than the other, that hand does outside throws.   5 ball halfshower 3 up 360 animation    5 ball halfshower 5 up 360 animation   Outside throws with rings and clubs are normally done with the props turned sideways ( flat fronts ). In a halfshower, the flat fronts can be thrown behind the other throws to avoid collisions. You can transition from a 5 ball  cascade to the synch halfshower (6x,4x) the same way you would transition to (6x,4)* - make two crossing throws from one hand in the cascade at 6 ball height: ...5555555555 6x56x1x (6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade , do a pair of (6x,4x) throws with the lower throw at 5 ball height: ...(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x)(6x,4x) (6x,5)(1x,5)! 5555555555... (The (1x,5) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (1x,5) pair.)   Siteswap transition animation   The term ""halfshower"" is also sometimes used for crossing patterns where one hand throws higher than the other without doing outside throws. Some jugglers find this to be the easiest way to juggle an even number of objects, especially 6 clubs .

This is the 4 object version of 531 . The right hand throws the first ball at 7 ball height (a 7), then the left hand throws the next ball at 5 ball height (a 5), less than half the height of the 7, then the right hand throws the next ball at 3 ball height (a 3), about a quarter of the height of the 5, and then the fourth ball is passed straight from the left hand to the right hand (a 1). Then the same throws are repeated, starting with the right hand throwing a 7 with the ball that was just passed to it. When the pattern is done with the right heights and a good even rhythm, all the objects peak at the same time.   4 ball 975300 360 animation   Siteswap exercises Edit  You can use these exercises to practice the same kinds of throws and sequences of throws that are done in this pattern, before you learn the full pattern.

The pattern is a repeating sequence of three different kinds of throws:      7b mills attempt  7 ball Mills mess by Daniel Eaker    The first throw is an outside throw . The next catch made by the hand making this throw should be done with that arm crossed over the other arm. The second throw is made under the arm , and the arms stay crossed so that the next catch made by that hand is also done under the arm. The third throw is made starting with the arms crossed , uncrossing them while throwing with the hand that's on top. This prop , when thrown with the right hand, goes over the top of the pattern from left to right. The next catch made by the hand making this throw should be done with the arms uncrossed.  These three throws are done starting with the right hand and the left hand alternately. Unless this trick is combined with a siteswap , in a Mills mess pattern with an odd number of objects the objects are always thrown with one hand and caught with the other hand, and in a pattern with an even number of objects each object is always thrown and caught with the same hand. Because all the throws are made on the outside of the pattern, it's easier to transition into Mills mess from a reverse cascade or fountain than from the basic pattern .     3 ball Mills mess   4 ball Mills mess   5 ball Mills mess       Three Ball Mills Mess Tutorial  3 ball Mills mess tutorial       Juggling Tutorial 4 ball Mills' Mess - part I  4 ball Mills mess tutorial ( part 1 , part 2 , part 3 )    World records Edit  Mills mess records with publicly available video evidence:  3 ball Mills mess: 1 hour, 11 minutes, and 9 seconds by Luka Tchernia in 2017 ( video ) 4 ball Mills mess: 21 minutes and 22 seconds by Dominik Braun in 2018 ( video ) 5 ball Mills mess: 10 minutes and 43 seconds by Thomas Dietz in 2009 ( video ) 6 ball Mills mess: 146 catches by Josiah Jones in 2007 ( video ) 7 ball Mills mess: 22 catches by Michael Pearce in 2018 ( video )  4 ring Mills mess: 1 minute and 32 seconds by Marc Schneider in 2015 ( video ) 5 ring Mills mess: 38 catches by Kip Hunt in 2014 ( video )  3 club Mills mess: 26 minutes by Kip Hunt in 2014 ( video ) 4 club Mills mess: 2 minutes and 44 seconds by Marc Schneider in 2018 ( video ) 5 club Mills mess: 79 catches by Toby Walker in 2008 ( video ) 6 club Mills mess: 12 catches by Toby Walker in 2011 ( video )  Unverified claims:  3 ball Mills mess: 2 hours and 30 minutes by Luka Tchernia in 2016 ( claim ) 6 ball Mills mess: 850 catches by Josiah Jones ( claim ) 7 ball Mills mess: 24 catches by Josiah Jones in 2007 ( claim ) 8 ball Mills mess: 12 catches by Nick Thomas ( claim ) 9 ball Mills mess: 11 catches by Nick Thomas ( claim )  Alternative names Edit  Mills Mess Alternating cross-armed pattern Pretzel  Variations Edit     Flo's mess  After the under-the-arm throw, you uncross your arms and do an outside throw instead of doing a cross-armed throw.

The throws are made with the arms crossed , changing which hand is on top each time, and the catches are made with the arms uncrossed. The throws in this pattern look like crossing throws, but each ball is actually caught by the same hand that threw it, because it is thrown with the arms crossed and caught with the arms uncrossed. 5 ball Burke's Burrage is a multiplex pattern with the siteswap [44][22]3. It is a combination of Burke's barrage (a 423 pattern where a ball is carried through the middle of the pattern, under the 4) and takeouts (a variation of Burke's barrage where the ball is carried over the 4). In 5 ball Burke's Burrage, each 4 is replaced with a stacked multiplex - a [44] - so the balls can be carried under one 4 and over the other, through the middle of the stack.

One hand juggles 3 objects in the high-low pattern 8040 while the other just juggles 2. All the 8s are done with the same two objects. The 8s are about three times as high as the cascade , and the 4s are about half the height of the cascade. Each 8 should peak at the same time as the next 4 from the same hand. This is the 5 object version of 7333 , and can be done either synch or asynch.

This pattern is a good exercise to work on to prepare for the 6 ball  fountain , since it's just like an 6 ball fountain except one hand is only juggling 2 balls. That hand throws to the same height as the hand juggling 3, but at half the speed, so the hand juggling 2 only makes one throw for every two throws made by the hand juggling 3, and there is a pause on every 4th beat. The 6s should be about 1 1/2 times as high as the basic pattern . This is the 5 object version of 552 , and can be done either synch or asynch.

In the fountain pattern, two one-handed patterns are done at the same time, with each hand juggling half of the objects, so the objects never cross from one hand to the other. Each object is thrown at a slight angle away from the center of the body, so that it is caught on the outside of the pattern by the same hand that threw it. All the objects are thrown to the same height. Fountains are the most common patterns for juggling even numbers of objects. In the asynch fountain, the hands throw one at a time, on an even, alternating rhythm. In the synch fountain, both hands throw at the same time. An asynch fountain is represented in siteswap notation as a single even number. A synch fountain is written as two of the same even number, inside parentheses and separated with a comma. Before learning a 4 ball fountain, you should already be good at 2 in one hand , 441 , and 4 with a gap (starting each one from both sides). Before learning a 6 ball fountain, you should already be good at 3 balls in one hand (with each hand), 4 ball high flashes , 6662 or (6,6)(6,2) , and 6 with a gap (starting each one from both sides). You can switch a fountain pattern from asynch to synch or synch to asynch, by throwing all or all but one of the objects on one side higher than the rest of the pattern (e.g. throwing 2 or 3 balls from the right hand at 7 ball height in a 6 ball fountain).   4 ball fountain transition animation    6 ball fountain transition animation   The highest number of objects that have been qualified (at least twice as many catches as objects) in a fountain is 10 ( balls and rings , synch and asynch), and the highest number of objects that have been flashed (same number of throws and catches as objects) in a fountain is 14 balls (asynch, by Alex Barron ).

A split is a multiplex throw where some of the objects are thrown to the right hand, and some to the left hand. In the simplest case, a duplex split, two objects are thrown from one hand and split apart in the air so that one object lands in each hand. Any split throw involving more than two objects contains at least one stack . A triplex where one object is caught in one hand and two are caught in the other hand is a split multiplex, but the two objects that are caught in the same hand are ""stacked"". In an ""inside"" split triplex, one object is thrown across to the other hand and the other two are thrown as a self stack, and in an ""outside"" split triplex, one object is thrown as a self throw and the other two are thrown as a crossing stack. Any odd number of objects can be juggled in a multiplex pattern by throwing duplex splits with the right and left hands alternately at a constant height.    5 ball duplex splits Siteswap : [32T] or [54][22]2 or ([44x],2)* 7 ball duplex splits Siteswap: [43] or ([66x],2)* 7 ball triplex splits Siteswap: [32T2T] or [544][222]2 or ([444x],2)*   8 ball duplex splits Siteswap: ([44x],[44x]) 8 ball triplex splits Siteswap: [332T] or [554][222][22] or ([44x4x],[22])* 9 ball duplex splits Siteswap: [54] or ([88x],2)*   9 ball quadruplex splits Siteswap: [32T2T2T] or [5444][2222]2 or ([4444x],2)* 10 ball triplex splits Siteswap: [433] or ([66x6x],2)* 10 ball quadruplex splits Siteswap: [332T2T] or [5544][2222][22] or ([444x4x],[22])*      Splits  5 ball tricks with high duplex splits by Peter Bone    See also Edit  Stack  Slice  Squeeze     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Split?oldid=10576 ""     "
Quads,,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Quads,"         Quadruple rotations or quads are throws where each club  rotates four times before being caught. The basic patterns for 8 and 9 clubs are usually done with quads, but some jugglers use triples for 8. Tricks that can be done using quads include 3 club 1080s , 4 and 5 club 720s , 5 club 97531 , and 6 and 7 club 360s . Quads with less than 8 clubs is a more difficult trick than the basic patterns for those numbers, which are normally done with singles , doubles , or triples . Those numbers can be done with quads at their normal heights, using fast spins , or in a slower pattern, with the same kinds of high throws that would be used to juggle 8 or 9 clubs.      7 club run  7 club quads    See also Edit  Club rotation  Singles  Doubles  Triples  Quins  Flats  Reverse spins     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Quads?oldid=15541 ""     "

Doubles,,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Doubles,"         Double rotations or doubles are throws where each club  rotates twice before being caught. The basic patterns for 4 and 5 clubs are normally done with double rotations. Higher numbers are normally done with the clubs rotating at least three times per throw, and juggling those numbers with double rotations is a more difficult trick. Throw height and rotation speed can be controlled separately, so doubles with more than 5 clubs do not have to be done any lower than the basic patterns with the normal number of rotations. Double rotations with 3 clubs is also a more difficult trick than the basic pattern, which is normally done with singles . 3 club doubles can be done at a normal 3 club height, using fast  spins , or in a higher, slower pattern, with the same kind of throws used in a 5 club pattern, which is a good thing to work on to prepare for learning 5 clubs.

Windmill,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/3/33/3_windmill_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Windmill,"         The windmill (also called a false shower or fake shower ) is a juggling pattern where one hand does outside throws and the other hand throws under the arm . The catches made by the hand that does outside throws are done with that arm crossed over the other arm .     In the windmill, all the throws start on the same side of the pattern and cross over to the other side (from right to left if you throw under the arm with your left hand). This makes the objects follow each other around in a circle, like they do in a shower pattern.   In the reverse windmill, the throws that aren't just outside throws are made with the hand crossed over the other arm, and then those throws are caught under the arm.     In Mills mess , you do two throws of a windmill (outside, then under-the-arm) on alternating sides, with a cross-armed throw in between to transition to the other direction.   In Flo's mess , you do two throws of a windmill (under-the-arm, then outside) on alternating sides, with an outside throw in between to transition to the other direction.       4ball windmill 80catch  4 ball windmill by Yuichiro Kondo       365JT №114 Reverse Windmill  3 ball reverse windmill       The Windmill and Burke's Barrage Juggling Tutorial 4  Windmill and Burke's barrage tutorial      Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Windmill?oldid=21520 ""     "

Basic_pattern,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/1/11/3_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Basic_pattern,"         Basic patterns are the simplest kind of juggling patterns. In these patterns, every throw is the same height, and either all the throws cross from one side of the pattern to the other, or none of them do. In most basic patterns, objects are thrown from the inside of the pattern and caught on the outside. Basic patterns have no special kinds of throws or catches like backcrosses , multiplexes , or penguins . There are four basic patterns for two-handed toss juggling :    2-handed basic patterns Asynchronous (One hand throws at a time)  Synchronous (Both hands throw at the same time)    Crossing (Each object is thrown with one hand and caught with the other)    Cascade     Wimpy pattern     Non-crossing (Each object is thrown and caught with the same hand)    Asynch fountain     Synch fountain    The cascade can be done with any odd number of objects, and the wimpy and fountain patterns can be done with any even number. These are the easiest (non- multiplex ) ways to ( toss ) juggle any number of objects. Other juggling patterns are generally variations built on the basic patterns.     4 ball lift bounce    4 ball force bounce    With clubs , the basic pattern is normally done with each throw rotating half as many times as the number of clubs being juggled, rounding down for odd numbers: 3 clubs are done with single rotations, 4 and 5 are done with doubles , 6 and 7 are done with triples , 8 and 9 are done with quads . Any higher or lower number of rotations is usually considered a more difficult trick. There are two kinds of basic patterns for bounce juggling : the lift bounce and the force bounce . Unlike most basic patterns, bounce juggling patterns are normally done with outside throws . Even numbers of balls are usually bounced juggled in a wimpy pattern , rather than a fountain . The basic pattern for one-handed juggling is the ""rolling out"" pattern, where the objects go in an arc to the right (clockwise) if the right hand is being used, or to the left (counter-clockwise) if the left hand is being used.     2 in 1 hand   3 in 1 hand   4 in 1 hand   The 1-count is the most difficult basic pattern for passing , but it is commonly used for passing world records because only the number of passes caught is counted in the records. 2-counts and 4-counts are the most popular basic patterns for passing. An easier pattern for beginning passers is the 6-count .     6 ball 1-count    6 ball 2-count      6 ball 4-count    6 ball 6-count    There are three basic patterns for passing with three hands :     For a number of objects that is 1 more than a multiple of 3, if the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is counter-clockwise.   For a number of objects that is 1 less than a multiple of 3, if the objects are thrown from one hand to the next hand in a counter-clockwise order, the throwing order for the hands is clockwise.   For a number of objects that is a multiple of 3, all three hands throw at the same time.   The basic pattern for juggling multiple diabolos is a circular pattern which can be done either high (with only one diabolo on the string at a time) or low (with more than one diabolo one the string at a time, called a shuffle ).

Three balls are juggled in a cascade at 6 ball height, and the other two balls go up and down on the sides of the pattern at 4 ball height. Each time you throw, you throw two balls: The right hand does a high crossing throw (a 6x), and the left hand does a low non-crossing throw (a 4). Then the same throws are repeated, but with the left hand throwing a 6x and the right hand throwing a 4. The high throws should be almost three times as high as the low throws.   Video : 5 ball (6x,4)* with the 6s as backcrosses by Daniela Paličková    Video : 5 ring (6x,4)* with the 4s as pancakes by Chris Hodge    Video : 5 club (6x,4)* with the 4s as lazies by Wes Peden   The simplest way to transition from a cascade to (6x,4)* is to make two crossing 6 ball height throws from one hand in the cascade: ...5555555555 6x56x1x (4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)... (The 1x is a very short pause in the pattern while holding a ball in the hand that would have thrown next after the second 6x.) To transition back to the cascade, do a pair of (6x,4) throws with the higher throw at 7 ball height, and then a normal pair of (6x,4) throws: ...(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x)(6x,4)(4,6x) (7,4)(4,6x)(5,1x)! 5555555555... (The (5,1x) is just the first cascade throw, while holding a ball in the other hand a little longer than usual. The exclamation mark means that there is no empty beat after the synchronous (5,1x) pair.)   Transition animation   You can switch between (6x,4)* and (6,4x)* at any time during the patterns, as long as you always alternate throwing two objects to the left and throwing two objects to the right. Most of the high throws for a 360 in a (6x,4)* pattern are pairs of (8x,6) throws, but for a 3-up or 5-up 360, the first pair of high throws is (8x,4): a 3-up is (8x,4)(6,8x)(2,2) , and a 5-up is (8x,4)(6,8x)(8x,6)(0,0) . A 4-up 360 can be done with only (8x,6)s, without an (8x,4): (8x,6)(6,8x)(2,0) .

The throws are made in the positions where the catches were made in the original pattern and vice versa.  Reversed throws and catches Edit  In a basic  cascade , each throw goes under the incoming prop . All the objects are thrown on the inside of the pattern and caught on the outside. The right-hand and left-hand throws cross paths on the way up. In a reverse cascade , each throw goes over the incoming prop. All the objects are thrown on the outside of the pattern and caught on the inside. The right-hand and left-hand throws cross paths on the way down. Clubs are normally thrown so that they rotate with the top moving toward the juggler. Reverse spins are throws where clubs rotate in the opposite direction, with the top of the club moving away from the juggler. A lift bounce and a force bounce are time-reversed versions of each other. In a lift bounce, the balls are caught and thrown while moving upward, and they cross paths on the way down. In a force bounce, the balls are caught and thrown while moving downward, and they cross paths on the way up. A reverse multiplex throw is a squeeze catch - instead of throwing two or more objects from the same hand at the same time, you catch two or more objects in the same hand at the same time. The reverse of an under the arm throw is an under the arm catch, and the reverse of an under the leg throw is an under the leg catch. In backcrosses , the throws are made behind the back and caught in front, coming forward on the same side of the body where they're caught. In reverse backcrosses , the throws are made in front and caught behind the back, going back on the same side of the body where they're thrown. In shoulder throws , the throws are made behind the back and caught in front, coming forward on the same side of the body where they're thrown. In reverse shoulder throws , the throws are made in front and caught behind the back, going back on the same side of the body where they're caught. The time-reversed version of body throws would be continuous blind catches , but the terms ""reverse body throws"" and ""treblas"" (meaning ""reverse Alberts "") are used to refer to a different trick, back-to-front body throws, which are the reverse of normal body throws only in the sense that the clubs go through the legs in the opposite direction. The reverse of a kick-up is a foot catch.  Reversed patterns Edit  The reverse of a right-handed shower is a left-handed shower, and the reverse of a right-handed halfshower is a left-handed halfshower. 3 ball tennis is a cascade with an outside throw every third throw. 3 ball reverse tennis is a reverse cascade with an inside throw every third throw. In the windmill , one hand always throws under the arm, and in the reverse windmill, one hand always catches under the arm. In Mills mess , all the throws are made on the outside of the pattern. A 3 ball reverse Mills mess is the same as a normal Mills mess, except the under the arm throw is made on the inside of the pattern, going up in between the other two balls. The shuffle is a shower with slams , which go down through the pattern diagonally. The reverse shuffle is a shower with reverse slams, which go up through the pattern diagonally. Doing a time-reversed Boston mess is the same as doing the Boston mess with the roles of the right and left hands reversed. In a time-reversed cherry picker , the hands move through the columns in the opposite direction. Jay's jumble and Luke's lobotomy are roughly time-reversed versions of each other.  Reversed siteswaps Edit  Juggling a siteswap in reverse often results in the same siteswap pattern, but sometimes the reverse of a siteswap is a different pattern that is an anagram of the original siteswap. To find the time-reverse of a siteswap, move each number in the siteswap that number of places to the right (move a 1 one place to the right, or a 2 two places to the right etc.), and then read the resulting sequence backwards. Example: Start with 12345 , and move the numbers to the right to get 31425 (the 3 was moved three places to the right, to the spot just after the 5, which is the position of the 1 in the original pattern, and the 5 moving five places to the right in a period 5 pattern puts it back where it started), then read 31425 backwards to get 52413 .

The throwing hand throws objects across to the catching hand, and the catching hand passes the objects back over to the throwing hand. A shower can be represented in siteswap notation by either an odd number followed by 1 (e.g. 51 , 71 , 91 ), or an even number with an ""x"" followed by a 2x in synchronous notation (e.g. (4x,2x) , (6x,2x) , (8x,2x) ). Either way, the two numbers in the siteswap should add up to twice the number of objects in the pattern.

A half contortion is a pattern done with one arm wrapped around the back, and reaching forward between the other arm and the torso. If the right hand is wrapped behind the back, it's still positioned to the right of the left hand, in between the left arm and the left side. All the throws and catches done by that hand are made in this position. In the full contortion , both arms are wrapped around the back and the pattern is still juggled in front. This restricts the movement of the arms so that the throws have to be made accurately using the wrists.

6-count,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/7/70/6_6count_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/6-count,"         A 6-count is a passing pattern where every sixth throw is a pass. Beginning passers usually start passing 6 objects in a 6-count pattern. The same two objects are passed every time they're thrown with the right hands (assuming the pattern is done right-handed). With 8 objects it can be done either entirely in the wimpy pattern , alternating between throwing a right hand pass and a left hand crossing throw, and then two pairs of crossing throws, or the two pairs of synch throws between passes can be non-crossing, so the pattern alternates between two throws of a wimpy pattern with one hand throwing to the other person, and four throws of a synch fountain . The second method is the one that would be used for rings and clubs since those props are not good for wimpy patterns. In a 6-count with an odd number, each person alternates between doing three throws of the basic asynch solo patterns for two different numbers that add up to the number of objects being used in the passing pattern. A 7 ball 6-count alternates between three 4 ball throws and three 3 ball throws, and a 9 ball 6-count alternates between three 5 ball throws and three 4 ball throws. Each time one of the jugglers does a set of three higher throws, the last of the three throws is a pass (a straight pass if it's at an even-number height, e.g. a 4 in a 7 ball pattern, and a diagonal pass if it's at an odd-number height, e.g. a 5 in a 9 ball pattern). To start the pattern, the person holding more objects starts juggling by doing three high throws (the last of which is a pass), and then the other person makes their first throw (also starting with three high throws) at the same time as the first person makes their fourth throw.    6 ball 6-count <3p|3p><3|3><3|3><3|3><3|3><3|3>  7 ball 6-count <R|L><4|3><4|3><4xp|3><3|4><3|4><3|4xp>    8 ball 6-count <(4x,4xp)|(4x,4xp)><(4,4)|(4,4)><(4,4)|(4,4)>  9 ball 6-count <R|L><5|4><5|4><5xp|4><4|5><4|5><4|5xp>   See also Edit  1-count  2-count  3-count  4-count     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/6-count?oldid=19660 ""     "

All the throws are the same height. The first object should be caught at about the same time that the last object is thrown. A snake pattern is a cascade with as many gaps in it as possible without having any consecutive gaps. It can be used as an exercise to prepare for learning a cascade with nearly twice as many objects as there are in the snake.

Feed,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/1/17/3p_9_2count_feed_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Feed,"          This article is about multi-person passing patterns. The term ""feed"" may also refer to handing an object directly from one hand into the other, as you would do in a shower .   A feed is a passing pattern where one juggler (the feeder ) passes with two or more other jugglers (the feedees ), who only pass with the feeder, not with each other. The feedees pass less often than the feeder, because each feedee has to wait their turn while the feeder passes to each of the other feedees. Feeds are typically done with the feedees standing next to each other in a line and facing the feeder. In a basic 3-person feed, the feeder does a 2-count , alternating which feedee to pass to. The feedees both do 4-counts out of time with each other, so they throw to themselves while the other feedee is throwing to the feeder. A 3-person 10 object feed is similar to a 2-person 7 ball 2-count: the passes are 4s and the self throws are 3s. The feedees both throw with the right hand while the feeder is throwing with the left hand and vice versa. Whenever the feeder passes to either feedee, that feedee passes to the feeder on the next beat. A 3-person 11 object feed is similar to a 2-person 7 ball 4-count: the passes are 5s and the self throws are 3s. Whenever the feeder passes to either feedee, the other feedee passes to the feeder at the same time. The most common way to do a feed with more than three people is a sweep feed , where the feeder passes with each feedee along the line from left to right, and then goes back along the line from right to left. A can do a sweep feed with B, C, and D by passing with them in this order: B C D C B C D C... A does a 2-count, C does a 4-count, and B and D do 8-counts . The two jugglers at the ends of the line of feedees in a sweep feed pass less often than the rest of the feedees. In a typewriter feed , all the feedees do the same count. The feeder passes with each feedee along the line, and then jumps back to the other end of the line and continues to go along the line in the same direction. A can do a typewriter feed with B, C, and D by passing with them in this order: B C D B C D B C D... A does a 2-count, and each feedee does a 6-count .     3-person 9 ball 2-count feed <3p2|3p1|3><3|3|3> <3p3|3|3p1><3|3|3>   3-person 9 ball 1-count feed <3p2|3p1|3><3p3|3|3p1>     3-person 10 ball 2-count feed <R|L|L><4xp2|3|3><3|4xp1|3><4xp3|3|3><3|3|4xp1>   3-person 11 ball 2-count feed <5p2|3|5p1><3|3|3> <5p3|5p1|3><3|3|3>     3-person 12 ball 2-count feed <(4x,4xp2)|(4x,4xp1)|(4,4)><(4x,4xp3)|(4,4)|(4x,4xp1)>   3-person 12 ball 1-count feed (two separate 3-handed 6 ball patterns done at the same time) <(4xp3,4xp2)|(4x,4p1)|(4p1,4x)>     4-person 12 ball sweep feed <3p4|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3><3p2|3p1|3|3><3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3>   4-person 12 ball typewriter feed <3p4|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3><3p2|3p1|3|3><3|3|3|3>     5-person 15 ball typewriter feed with the feeder turning in a circle  <3p2|3p1|3|3|3><3|3|3|3|3><3p3|3|3p1|3|3><3|3|3|3|3><3p4|3|3|3p1|3><3|3|3|3|3><3p5|3|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3|3>   12 ball N feed  <3p4|3|3|3p1><3|3|3|3><3p3|3p4|3p1|3p2><3|3|3|3>   Feed patterns Edit  Gordon's feed  Parker 4-3 feed  Chuck's 4-3-2 feed  Chuck's Irregular feed  Civil war  Every other every other  Jim's 2-3 feed  Civil war half half  Keith's feed  Reading romp feed  Raccoon   Ogie's nightmare  Random feed  Speed weave   Sunshine patterns  Mesopotamia  JaSoN countdown   Martin's mildness  Martin's madness  Technofeed  Alan's anguish   Rotating feed  Alternating feed  Circle feed   Extended feed  Feast       3 person 16 club world record  16 club  1-count feed by Peter Kaseman , Stefan Brancel , and Sean Carney       SJRI Russian Typewriter  Typewriter feed in a line formation       SJRI Extra-Club Random Feed (3 feedees)  Random feed       SJRI Simul Feed  Simul feed       SJRI 9p Extended Feed  9 person extended feed       SJRI 3-Way Circle Feed  3-way circle feed      Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Feed?oldid=13071 ""     "

You don't have to reach or bend down and throw from an unusually low position, just bring your leg up high enough that you can easily put your hand under it while juggling. The most common way to throw under the leg is throwing under the same leg : if you're using your right hand, you throw under your right leg. You can also throw under the opposite leg (e.g. throwing with the right hand under the left leg). If you squat down or jump, it's possible to throw an object under both legs at the same time. Normally if the right hand throws under either leg, it moves under the leg from right to left, and then throws on the left side of the leg. A more difficult variation is to move your hand under your leg in the opposite direction: move your right hand under either leg from left to right, and throw from the right side of your leg. An under the leg catch is an under the leg throw in reverse : you lift your leg up into the pattern, reach under your leg with an empty hand, and catch an object in this position.

Behind_the_back_looking,,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Behind_the_back_looking,"         Behind the back looking is a trick where you make all the throws and catches behind the back, while looking at the objects by either turning your head from side to side to look back over your shoulders, or throwing high and looking straight up. This kind of pattern is higher than a blind behind the back pattern, and the objects don't touch your back.

Going into 5 throws of a 5 ball trick from a warm start and back to the basic pattern afterwards would also be called a flash of the trick. Flashing a trick can begin with either a cold start or a warm start, and end with either a collect or a re-entry to the basic pattern or another pattern. The term ""flash"" is also sometimes used for any non- qualifying run where each object is caught at least once. The highest numbers of props that have been flashed are 14 balls by Alex Barron , 13 rings by Albert Lucas , 12 ball bounce by Alan Sulc , and 9 clubs .        14 Ball Flash  14 ball flash by Alex Barron       Anthony Gatto 12 Rings World Record  12 ring flash by Anthony Gatto       9 Club Flash  9 club flash by Ben Thompson     High flash Edit  A ""flash"" can also mean throwing all of the props higher than the basic pattern so that both hands are briefly empty (or throwing all but one or two high and pausing briefly). A high flash can be used as an exercise to prepare for learning to juggle a higher number of objects. Juggle the basic pattern at the same speed you will use for the higher number (possibly slightly faster than the speed you normally use for the number you're juggling now), and keep throwing at the same speed while you do the high flash. If you're preparing for a pattern with two more objects, you should pause for two beats after the flash, before you start throwing again. If the pause is less than two beats long, you need to throw higher or faster. You can clap your hands together while the objects are in the air to make sure your hands are both empty long enough. You can also do other things such as 360s , 720s, or backflips while the objects are in the air after a high flash.      3 ball 2 up flashes Siteswap : 5520     4 ball 2 up flashes Siteswap: 6622       4 ball asynch 3 up flashes Siteswap: 66620     4 ball synch 4 up flashes Siteswap: (6,6)(6,6)(0,0)       5 ball 3 up flashes Siteswap: 77722     5 ball 4 up flashes Siteswap: 777720    See also Edit  Qualify  Run     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Flash?oldid=20060 ""     "

Catching under the arm is the same thing in reverse : crossing your arms and catching an object in the lower hand. In a windmill , one hand does every throw under the arm and the other hand does outside throws . In a cross-armed pattern , one hand does every throw and every catch under the arm. In Mike's mess , both hands do every throw and every catch under the arm. To do a wrist drop , you start with your arms crossed, drop an object down from the hand on top, uncross your arms and re-cross them the other way, and catch the object under the arm on the same side of the pattern and with the same hand that dropped it.

Each object is thrown at an angle, moving across from one hand to the other, with the hands throwing in an even, alternating rhythm. Each object is thrown to the same height as the previous one, and the pattern with three objects has at any point one or two objects in the air and at least one in the jugglers hands. The pattern may be made higher and/or faster for more objects such as a 5 ball cascade. A cascade is represented in siteswap notation as a single odd number. The highest number of objects that have been qualified (at least twice as many catches as objects) in a cascade is 11 balls (by Alex Barron ), and the highest number of objects that have been flashed (same number of throws and catches as objects) in a cascade is 13 balls (by Alex Barron ).

The ""chop"" is done while holding on to an object after catching it - the object is brought swiftly down through the pattern before moving under the opposite arm to be thrown. A chop can start from a normal catching position, arcing up and then down through the pattern, or you can start the chop by catching an object close to where it peaks, and bring it straight down diagonally through the pattern. The second way is faster and more difficult.

1-count,,,https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/juggle/images/9/93/5_1count_200.gif,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/1-count,"         A 1-count is a passing pattern where every throw is a pass. Since this is an ambidextrous pattern, it's more difficult than a 2-count . In passing world records , only the number of passes caught is counted, so numbers passing records are commonly done in 1-count patterns because the easier 2-count would have to be done twice as long to get the same number of caught passes. In a 2-person 1-count with an even number of objects, each person does a pass on every throw while juggling in a cascade or a fountain . This results in two cascades or wimpy patterns each done with one juggler's right hand and the other juggler's left hand. It can be done asynch or synch. In a 6 (or 10, 14, 18) object synch 1-count, the jugglers take turns throwing with both hands at the same time. In an 8 (or 12, 16, 20) object synch 1-count, all four hands throw at the same time. In an 6 object asynch 1-count, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. In an 8 object asynch 1-count, one juggler's right hand throws at the same time as the other juggler's left hand. Collisions can be avoided in an 8 object 1-count by having one person throw passes on the outside of the pattern and the other person throw passes on the inside of the pattern, or by having one person throw at 5-height and the other person throw at 3-height, with the jugglers taking turns throwing with both hands at the same time. A 1-count with an odd number of objects can be done with every throw the same height, and only one hand throwing at a time. One person throws diagonal passes, and the other person throws straight passes. Both people juggle at a normal speed, each throwing in between the other's throws. The order the hands throw in depends on the number of objects being juggled. For a number just above a multiple of 4 (5, 9, 13, 17), the throwing order is: diagonal-passer's right hand, straight-passer's right hand, diagonal-passer's left hand, straight-passer's left hand. For a number just below a multiple of 4 (7, 11, 15, 19), the throwing order is: diagonal-passer's right hand, straight-passer's left hand, diagonal-passer's left hand, straight-passer's right hand. The straight-passer does their first throw (a pass) right after the diagonal-passer's first throw. If the diagonal-passer starts with their right hand, the straight-passer's first pass is with their left hand for 7 objects, or their right hand for 9 objects. A less collision-prone way to do a 1-count with an odd number of objects is to have the diagonal-passer throw higher than the straight-passer. (The two jugglers should throw at the heights of the basic solo patterns for two consecutive numbers that add up to the number of objects being passed, e.g. 3s and 4s for passing 7, or 4s and 5s for passing 9.) In this kind of 1-count, the hands are synchronized: for a number just above a multiple of 4, one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand, and for a number just below a multiple of 4, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time. To start the pattern, the diagonal-passer throws one object first, and then the straight-passer makes their first throw at the same time as the diagonal-passer makes their second throw. The 2-height 1-count can also be done with the straight-passer throwing higher than the diagonal-passer. In this kind of 1-count, for a number just above a multiple of 4, both right hands throw at the same time, and both left hands throw at the same time, and for a number just below a multiple of 4, one person's right hand throws at the same time as the other person's left hand. To start the pattern, the straight-passer throws one object first, and then the diagonal-passer makes their first throw at the same time as the straight-passer makes their second throw.     5 ball 1-height 1-count <(2,4p)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(2,4xp)><(4p,2)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(4xp,2)>   5 ball 2-height 1-count (diagonal 3s) <R|L><3xp|2xp>   5 ball 2-height 1-count (straight 3s) <3p|2p>     6 ball asynch 1-count <3p|3p>   6 ball synch 1-count <(3p,3p)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3p,3p)!>   6 ball asynch diagonal 1-count <R|L><3xp|3xp>     6 ball synch diagonal 1-count <(3xp,3xp)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3xp,3xp)!>   7 ball 1-height 1-count <(2,8p)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(8xp,2)><(8p,2)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(2,8xp)>   7 ball 2-height 1-count (diagonal 4s) <4p|3p>     7 ball 2-height 1-count (straight 4s) <R|L><4xp|3xp>   8 ball synch 1-count <(4xp,4xp)|(4xp,4xp)>   8 ball asynch 1-count <R|L><4xp|4xp>     8 ball synch 53 1-count <(5p,5p)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(3p,3p)!>   8 ball asynch 53 1-count <5p|3p>   9 ball 1-height 1-count <(2,cp)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(2,cxp)><(cp,2)|(2,2)><(2,2)|(cxp,2)>     9 ball 2-height 1-count (diagonal 5s) <R|L><5xp|4xp>   9 ball 2-height 1-count (straight 5s) <5p|4p>   10 ball asynch 1-count <5p|5p>     10 ball synch 1-count <(5p,5p)!|(0,0)!><(0,0)!|(5p,5p)!>   10 ball synch (6x,4x) 1-count <(6xp,6xp)|(4xp,4xp)>   10 ball asynch (6x,4x) 1-count <R|L><6xp|4xp>         16 ball world record (39 catches)!  16 ball 1-count by Peter Kaseman and Doug Sayers    Alternative names Edit  Ultimate passing  Ultimates  See also Edit  2-count  3-count  4-count  6-count     Retrieved from "" http://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/1-count?oldid=19656 ""     "

Slice,,,,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nWl93i5O9Y&amp;t=8s,,,",,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Slice,"         A slice is a multiplex throw where one of the objects is passed directly across to the other hand (written in siteswap notation with a 1 or 2x). This can be done by holding the catching hand above the throwing hand so that when the throw is made, one object goes straight up into the catching hand, and the other goes up past the catching hand and is caught on a later beat. A 3 ball  cascade with an extra ball passed back and forth at the bottom of the pattern using sliced multiplex throws (similar to a sprung cascade , but with the high and low throws that are made at the same time both coming from the same hand) could be written in siteswap as [31] or ([4x2x],2)*.

Elbow_bounce,,,,,,https://juggle.wikia.com/wiki/Elbow_bounce,"         To do an elbow bounce while juggling, skip one throw - the ball that you would have thrown stays in your hand until two beats later. Instead of throwing the ball, use the elbow of that arm to hit the next ball that arrives on that side of the pattern, so that it bounces back up and goes back in the direction of the hand that threw it. If you're juggling more than 3 balls, the throw that goes to your elbow should be a little lower than the rest of the pattern, because it needs to get to your elbow sooner than it would get to your hand if you were just doing the basic pattern . One way to do an elbow bounce is to bounce the ball off of the outside of your elbow, with your arm bent, your hand facing down, and your elbow sticking out to the side. Another way is to bounce it off the inside of your elbow, with your arm held out in front of you - straighten your arm, reaching forward with your hand facing up, so that the inside of your elbow comes up and hits the ball. If you want to continually do elbow bounces, you can hit the ball straight up so you can keep bouncing it on the same elbow, or bounce it back and forth from one elbow to the other, or juggle with one or both hands, with every throw bouncing off of an elbow.

That one object is never thrown high - it just gets passed back and forth at the bottom of the pattern. Alternating showers and patterns containing an object which is thrown only as siteswap 1 or 2, especially 52512, are known as ""baby juggling"" patterns. [1] The object being passed back and forth can be replaced with a fragile object or a baby because it can remain in contact with a hand at all times.

The basic pattern for 3 clubs is normally done with single rotations. Higher numbers are normally done with the clubs rotating more than once per throw, and juggling those numbers with single rotations is a more difficult trick. Throw height and rotation speed can be controlled separately, so singles with more than 3 clubs do not have to be done any lower than the basic pattern with the normal number of rotations.

Another 3 ball tennis pattern, called ""real tennis"", is a variation of 423 where the 3s go over the top of the pattern. Burke's barrage is a variation of real tennis where the 4 is thrown under the arm and the 3 is caught under the arm, and then the 2 is carried through the middle of the pattern as the arms uncross. 4 ball tennis doesn't work with a fountain pattern because there are no crossing throws, but it can be done in the wimpy pattern , or in the asynchronous siteswap  53444 . In 5 ball tennis, every fifth throw is an outside throw. ""Fast tennis"" is a 5 ball pattern where every third throw is an outside throw, like in 3 ball tennis. In fast tennis, every ball goes over the top at some point, instead of just one ball going back and forth over the top of the pattern. The umbrella is a trick where certain balls always go over the top like in a tennis pattern, but with synchronous outside throws.
